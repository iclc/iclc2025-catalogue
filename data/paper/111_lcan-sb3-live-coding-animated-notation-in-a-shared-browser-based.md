# $ABSTRACT

The LCAN SB3 (Live Coding Animated Notation in a Shared Browser-Based Buffer) was designed to create a
functional relationship between two seemingly disparate fields of practice: live-coding and animated notation.
While these two fields are both representative of the artist-programmer ethos, their differences lie in their
respective purposes. With live-coding the artist-programmer writes and executes code in real time with a
variety of audio and visual results in traditional and non-traditional performance environments. Animated
notation, like traditional notation, requires a specific symbol system, designed by the artist-programmer,
which indicates to human performers what musical event(s) to execute and when. The result of this
relationship is akin to a traditional performance environment, yet there is a divide between the composer
(artist-programmer) and the musical result by way of the performers. The authorâ€™s LCAN SB3 seeks to merge
these two fields by providing a platform by which the artist-programmer can live-code animated notations in
real time that can then be performed by one or more performers. The LCAN SB3 also provides support for a
shared browser-based buffer system in which two or more artist-programmers can create animated notation
in real time regardless of location, enabling the creation and presentation of the resultant animated score at
one or more remote sites.
