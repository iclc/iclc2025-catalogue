# $ABSTRACT

In this paper we introduce initial work in making 'algorithmic alphabets' as hand drawn
notation for choreographic live coding of robots, created within the Realtalk system. We
briefly review some prior art as inspirations, before introducing our initial system based on
recognition of symbols within rhythmic cycles, sharing the trajectory of our ongoing work.
