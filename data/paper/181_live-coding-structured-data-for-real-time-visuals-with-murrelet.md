# $ABSTRACT

Murrelet is a live coding framework where the performer manipulates expressions in a structured data input for a pre-programmed system. It has primarily been used for visuals. Performers have access to an extensible list of environmental variables derived from things like audio signals, time, OSC, MIDI, and Bluetooth. The structured data configuration paradigm is also useful outside of time-based media and has been used to fine-tune stills and SVGs for pen plotters. Several live-coded visual performances have been carried out based on Murrelet.
