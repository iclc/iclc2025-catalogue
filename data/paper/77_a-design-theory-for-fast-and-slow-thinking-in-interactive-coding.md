# $ABSTRACT

This paper introduces a new theory and shared language to help users and designers of interactive
programming (IP) systems, especially those aimed at producing “creative” multimedia outcomes such as
generative sculpture, art, music, graphics, and livecoding performances, to better identify key
programming activities and be more strategic about their application. The theory was inspired by two
complementary modes of thinking, “fast” (intuition) versus “slow” (deliberation). It defines three key
“activity clusters” called LiveCoding Performance, Experimental Interactive Programming, and
Exploratory Interactive Programming using the Cognitive Dimensions of Notations as a language to
discuss practice-based reflections and user studies of intuitive and deliberative activities in
performances, structured experimentation and software development, and open-ended creative
exploration. It interrogates the usability trade-offs between the three clusters during the design of
LivePrinter, the author’s interactive 3D printing (I3DP) and performance system. This positions these
activities within the author’s practice as an educator, sculptor, performer, and software developer who
experiments, composes, and performs, leading to some guidelines for other “creative” IP developers.
