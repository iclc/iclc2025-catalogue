# $ABSTRACT

Coypu is a Pharo package for programming music on-the-fly acting as a client for an external audio
generator server or for an internal DSP created with the Phausto library. Pharo is a fully
open-source dynamic and reflective pure object-oriented language, based on Smalltalk-80, which
includes an immersive integrated development environment.

Coypu was initially developed to pair with Symbolic Sound Kyma, as a full-stack Smalltalk
sound-design and live-coding environment, it was soon extended to interact with OSC servers such
as ChucK, PureData, and SuperCollider, and later expanded with MIDI capabilities. During the past
year, we added an API to provide a quick connection to the SuperDirt audio engine, featuring a
'String-Oriented' syntax heavily inspired by Tidal Cycles for creating what we call Sequencers.

The primary purpose of developing Coypu is to provide a pure object-oriented language
designed to cultivate creative coding literacy. We believe the Smalltalk-inspired approach to
constructivist learning is a gateway for newcomers, and individuals with little or no programming
experience. At the same time, being both reflective and modifiable, Coypu offers unlimited
possibilities to advanced users.

It offers an engaging entry point not only to more concise and expressive functional and
procedural programming languages but also to the world of computational systems, algorithms, and
general purpose programming.
