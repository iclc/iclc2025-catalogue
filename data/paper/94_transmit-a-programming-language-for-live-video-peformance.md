# $ABSTRACT

The paper delves into some of the artistic and conceptual processes behind designing and implementing TransMit, 
a programming language for live video I created as part of my doctoral project and
that I’ve been using for my artistic practice in the last year. This paper is divided into four sections.
The first section, "Introduction: Live Coding + Electronic Literature," overviews the importance of
two artistic practices, Live coding and Electronic Literature, that influenced TransMit. The second
section, "The path for TransMit," discusses the artistic influences encompassing incorporating TV-
related terminology into its syntax and using a library for dynamic manipulation of 3-dimensional
objects. The third section, "TransMit," examines TransMit’s lexicon, syntax, and semantics using
coding examples, going through its artistic and cultural implications and influences. The last section,
"Further Work: Technofeminisms and Cyberfeminisms," reflects how these practices influenced this
programming language and my learning journey.
