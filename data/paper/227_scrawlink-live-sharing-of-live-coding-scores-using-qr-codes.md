# $ABSTRACT

Live coding is a performance technique using programming languages to produce sounds and visuals, among others.
Typically, the code is programmed live. Sharing this code is often encouraged, and it is considered a key element of live
coding performances. However, this often happens only through the sharing of the performer’s screen. Using, studying,
sharing, and improving these programs (the four free software freedoms) is therefore a challenge, as access to the code
is lost after it changes or the performance finishes. This paper introduces Scrawlink, a software that enables sharing
the performance’s code in working live coding environments using QR codes. The proposal aims to provide affordable
and culturally appropriate ways to store, share, and reproduce live coding “scores” to support the open values of the
community, and enable new ways of collaboration, composition and inclusion. Scrawlink supports different web-based
languages, such as Strudel (audio), Hydra (visuals), or WebPD (web Pure Data instruments). It is performance oriented,
as the scores are automatically shared as the performer changes the code, and supports directly playing the scores in
working live coding environments. The tool facilitates live sharing of live coding scores, a practice that could be a key
to transform live coding, facilitating code sharing, collaboration and publishing practices.
