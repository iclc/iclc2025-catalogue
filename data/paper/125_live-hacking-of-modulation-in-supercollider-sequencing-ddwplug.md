# $ABSTRACT

The SuperCollider audio engine's architecture supports
live-coding-capable flexible modulation. Typically these modulators
are long-running, continuous modulation sources shared among
sequenced notes. Modulation that triggers per-note has been
difficult to improvise because temporary resources need to be
tracked and released. My recent ddwPlug Quark extension package
handles temporary connections between synthesis components,
expanding the possibilities for audio hacking within the context of
live-coded sequencing.
