# $ABSTRACT

This article explores Insider, a live deconstructed performance that revisits previous sound works
through the lens of hauntology. A successor to earlier research, Insider is a new artistic venture at the
intersection of live coding audio improvisation and emotionless performance narration. The work
examines philosophical, creative, and technical aspects of the performance, seeking to disrupt
conventional perceptions of time and explore the spectral dimensions of sound. By employing
Derrida's concept of hauntology, Insider navigates temporal modalities, evoking unease and a sense
of disconnection from the present. The performance employs the open-source software
SuperCollider, allowing for real-time mixing and spontaneous improvisation of deconstructed sound
works. These sound works, previously created for various installations, films, and multimedia
performances, are reinterpreted in real time, producing a fluid and ever-changing auditory landscape.
The integration of live narration, extracted from Bret Easton Ellis's The Informers (Ellis 1994) and
delivered in a detached and emotionless manner, acts as a grounding force amid the abstract audio
improvisation, introducing a contrasting element that enriches the sonic texture and invites the
audience into an altered auditory experience. Moreover, the adaptation of Insider to include
generative AI is being explored. The AI model, trained on the performerâ€™s historical recordings,
generates imperfect, spectral memories of the past. During live performances, the model is prompted
with live audio to produce these hazy spectres, which are then integrated back into the performance
using the live-coding platform. The juxtaposition of transformed sound and rigid narration, enhanced
by a powerful sound system, aims to create an immersive, unsettling atmosphere. Insider aspires to
build a listening community, exploring the relationship between sound art and hauntology. The
article suggests future iterations involving multi-channel expansion, distinct narration styles, and
enhanced audience participation to enrich the immersive experience and investigate the interplay
between abstraction and specificity in auditory culture.
