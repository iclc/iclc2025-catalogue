# $ABSTRACT

In this article, I propose an approach to analyzing Live Coding as an artistic practice that prioritizes
collective exploration—engaging all its constituent agents—over individual pursuits. This
perspective enables a deeper reflection on the relationships between its components. By examining
the elements that constitute this practice and their interactions, we can understand it as a complex
system that transcends the mere sum of its parts, drawing on concepts proposed by Jane Bennett.
Exploring these relationships, their dynamics, and the values they imply allows us to frame Live
Coding, particularly the "From Scratch" format. This perspective highlights the emergence of
unexpected elements arising from the interaction rules inherent to the practice.
