# $ABSTRACT

Touring is an important tool in the way musicians refine their craft, share their work, and support their creative processes. In 2024, we independently toured East Asia as live coding artists, performing audio-visual shows in Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Bangkok. This paper outlines our approach to planning, production, logistics, and the unique challenges we faced while touring. We reflect on how the tour helped us iterate on our performances, engage with diverse audiences, and navigate cultural and infrastructural differences in experimental art scenes. We aim to offer a guide for artists looking to tour independently in non-traditional formats.
