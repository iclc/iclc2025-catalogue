# $ABSTRACT

Both jazz and live-coding are musical traditions that rely heavily on improvisational practices. However, the current approach of TidalCycles to harmony is ill-fitted to meaningfully emulate jazz improvisation idioms. This paper introduces two families of functions proposed for inclusion in TidalCycles. The first set of functions aims at mimicking chromatic decorations, by transforming patterns through the insertion of a controlled number of chromatic notes. The second set of functions is setting to improve the language's current approach to scales, by allowing them to be functionally constructed in a way that reflects their underlying logic.
