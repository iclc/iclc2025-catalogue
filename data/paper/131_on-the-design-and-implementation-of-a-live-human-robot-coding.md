# $ABSTRACT

This paper presents a live coding platform for the construction of contemporary dance performances featuring human and robot performers. This platform was designed and implemented for a new choreographic work, *Together//Apart*, that uses live coded spatial patterns and algorithmic gesture patterns to create a performance score. We propose high level choreographic abstractions that model improvisational tasks for autonomous machines and human dancers as well as extend the Sardine live coding system to utilize these abstractions. Furthermore, we detail how we connect Sardine to our distributed systems architecture with platform-independent messaging, integrate robotics and sensing technology, and develop projections that enable the dynamic choreography of the human-robot team.
