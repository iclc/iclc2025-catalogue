# $ABSTRACT

This paper describes a system for interactive coding of flocks of sonic agents. The system is based on an animated two-dimensional visualization where the background represents sound information, and multiple agents make sound by traversing the space. The main interface is a domain-specific language that allows composing agent behaviours while the animation is running and playing. The system is demonstrated through Brunzit, a standalone application that supports real-time operation along with two different synthesis engines. The system is still in early development but some examples of its potential are demonstrated.
