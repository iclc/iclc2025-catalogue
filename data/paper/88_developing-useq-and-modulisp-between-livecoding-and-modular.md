# $ABSTRACT

uSEQ is an open-source, hybrid, and cyberphysical system bridging the software and hardware worlds of Live Coding (LC) and Hardware Modular Synthesis (HMS). Since its initial release and presentation at ICLC 2023, the design of uSEQ's hardware and of ModuLisp, the purpose-designed Domain-Specific Language (DSL) that powers it, has developed based on community feedback and evolving constraints. After several requests for a manufactured version, uSEQ was refined and released commercially as a plug-and-play module, in addition to a full DIY kit, broadening its reach to those unfamiliar with the DIY-from-scratch process that was originally required to build it. In this short paper, we reflect and report on these two years of the project's growth and refinement, exploring the factors that continue to influence and inform our design choices and the evolving development of the uSEQ module and the ModuLisp live coding language.
