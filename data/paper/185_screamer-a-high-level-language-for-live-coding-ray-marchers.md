# $ABSTRACT

I describe *Screamer*, a high-level language for live coding performances using ray marching. My motivation for Screamer was enabling faster iteration of three-dimensional scenes, especially in comparison with my prior work, the live coding environment marching.js. I discuss the underlying rendering engine of Screamer and its language features, and compare its notation with other live coding systems to help explain my design decisions. I conclude by discussing performances given using Screamer and future research directions
