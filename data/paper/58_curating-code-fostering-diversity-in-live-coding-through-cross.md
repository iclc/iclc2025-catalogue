# $ABSTRACT

This paper explores the role of curatorship within the live coding scene, focusing on the collaboration between Creative Coding Utrecht (CCU) and the Freedom City Festival as a case study for interdisciplinary curation. The collaboration combined live coding with hip-hop dance battles, focusing on improvisation, a shared element in both fields. By integrating diverse disciplines—such as music, shader coding, and visual art—the event created an inclusive, innovative program that embraced both artistic expression and technological creativity. The paper examines the challenges of uniting distinct audiences and discusses the importance of diversity within the live coding community, offering reflections on academic literature about curatorship, technology, and diversity. Finally, the paper outlines future directions for live coding, proposing further interdisciplinary collaborations to expand the diversity and inclusivity of the practice.
