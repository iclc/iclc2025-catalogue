# $ABSTRACT

In many multi-agent live coding environments and performances, performers are either sharing and manipulating a
common state and overriding each otherâ€™s changes to the state or to the flow of the code, or they are defining specific
sections each performer will work on, to avoid conflicts. The Absolute Relativity concept proposes an approach that
enables multiple agents to influence the same sound process(es) without overwriting the state but applying the difference
in state from the control to effect a change in control on the process parameters. Absolute Relativity was created with
physical controllers in mind, and we see this strategy as a really good alternative for hybrid setups combining live
coding and external controllers. Furthermore, by extending the concepts in Absolute Relativity, we also propose ideas
for how multiple live coders can play together influencing the same processes, in a more intuitive way.
