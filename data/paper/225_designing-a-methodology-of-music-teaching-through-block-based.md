# $ABSTRACT

At the public Music and Dance School “María Dolores Pradera” in Madrid, among the usual traditional
music instrument specializations, the computer is also offered. In this music course, live coding is used as
a teaching methodology to develop the necessary skills to perform music live with a computer. Teaching
music with code at the early stages of music education involves much more than just showing technology
and how a specific computer language works, it must develop the student’s musicianship and artistry.

In this paper, based on a six-year long experience of teaching at this specific music school, a description
of the abilities and skills in place to develop the student’s own musicianship and some examples of
successful methodologies applied are described. These methodologies are unified under a broader term
called the live coding toolkit, a pedagogical tool that allows the student to approach music learning using
block-based code snippets similarly to how, in traditional music education methodologies, musical études
have been used.
