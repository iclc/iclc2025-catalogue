# $ABSTRACT

mpaqtrrrrxnxs debut presents “mpaqtrrrrxnxs-archy,” a live performance that combines music, movement, and
visual art. Using dosisWeb, a web-based live coding interface for Arduino, we control sound-producing elements
and kinematic sculptures to create dynamic and interactive experiences.
During the performance, we will capture the physical sound and visual effects using cameras and microphones,
and process them with digital software commonly used in live coded performances. Our aim is to use this
speciﬁc combination of technology to explore the intersection of the digital and physical worlds.
Join us for a one-of-a-kind performance that combines music, movement, and light to create an immersive and
engaging experience.
