# $ABSTRACT

The dublang tool is a multi-language live coding system developed in
Lua using the Neovim text editor, it supports languages such as Tidal
Cycles, SuperCollider, FoxDot, Sardine, and some non-conventional tools
such as, OBS Studio, MPV, eSpeak, and other free software tools. With
dublang itâ€™s possible to do live coding of sounds and visuals from the
same source code file, combining the power of multiple tools in an
integrated environment.
