# $ABSTRACT

The dublang tool is a multi-language live coding system developed in Lua using the Neovim text editor. It supports
languages such as TidalCycles, SuperCollider, FoxDot, Sardine, and some non-conventional tools such as, OBS Studio,
MPV, eSpeak, and other free software tools. With dublang it is possible to do live coding of sounds and visuals from the
same source code file, combining the power of multiple tools in an integrated environment.
