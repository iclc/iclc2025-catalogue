# $ABSTRACT

We present Animatron, a visual live coding environment designed to
extend animation tools through Open Sound Control (OSC) messaging.
Unlike shader-based systems that focus on pixel manipulation,
Animatron uses image sequences as the building blocks for
improvisational collages of animation. The key contribution we will
focus on here is the introduction of hierarchical _defs_
(definitions) to extend OSC interfaces at runtime, allowing users to
define new commands and behaviours without recompilation or system
restart. This hierarchical structure enables the creation of complex,
reusable behaviours, tailored for live performance contexts. By
leveraging OSC itself as a live coding pseudo-language, Animatron
facilitates new forms of interactive, networked performances and
real-time animation. We also explore the broader implications of this
approach, suggesting its potential for adaptation in other live
coding systems and languages, expanding possibilities for live coding
interaction.
