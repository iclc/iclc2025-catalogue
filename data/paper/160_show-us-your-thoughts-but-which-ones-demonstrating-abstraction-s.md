# $ABSTRACT

Since the inception of live coding, but especially in the last 10 years, 
a central endeavor of the live coding community has been the development of *domain-specific languages* (DSLs), at various degrees of abstraction.
In this article, we first discuss the role of abstraction in live coding. 
Then, we demonstrate and analyze the abstraction levels of different DSLs, based on implementations of Steve Reich's *Clapping Music* (a minimalist algorithmic 
piece), and discuss the resulting affordances. The hypothesis we are supporting is that abstraction 
is instrumental in highlighting certain aspects of live coding, by determining 
which details a performer has to focus on during a live performance, which aspects of the code 
(and the thought process) are exposed, and which ones are hidden.
