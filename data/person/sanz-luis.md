Luis Sanz is a multidisciplinary artist working with synthetic sounds, computer graphics, and physical audiovisual experiences. His installations explore the relationship between bodies and spaces, creating immersive environments that reflect the interplay of video, spatial sound, sound synthesis, signal processing, and human perception. In his work, Sanz uses programming languages to develop rhythmic techniques and algorithmic processes for modulation and pattern generation in both digital and analogue devices. His compositions integrate noise, rhythms, processed field recordings, and computer music. Sanz co-founded fake[dac~], an algorithmic art platform in England, and Amarus, an experimental music network in Switzerland. He has performed extensively across Asia, Europe, and Latin America, both as a solo artist and as part of the electroacoustic noise duo Noijzu.
