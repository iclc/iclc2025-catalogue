He has performed extensively across Asia, Europe, and Latin America, presenting his work at festivals, galleries, and venues dedicated to experimental sound and computational arts.

In Zurich, Sanz is active in several initiatives including unsorted, a live coding collective focused on real-time audiovisual research, and farmhouse, a venue for sonic exploration and cross-disciplinary performance.
