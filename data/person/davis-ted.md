Ted Davis is a media artist / designer / educator based in Basel, Switzerland.
Since 2010 he teaches interaction design within the Institute Digital Communication Environments IDCE, Basel Academy of Art and Design HGK FHNW.
His work and teachings explore the volatility of digital media through glitch and
reactivating older ‘new media’ through newer programming means. His open
source projects (basil.js, XYscope, P5LIVE, HY5, p5.glitch) enable designers to
program within Adobe InDesign, render vector graphics on vector displays, collaboratively live code visuals with p5.js, and glitch any media in real-time within
the web browser. In 2019, he was a p5.js Contributing Conference participant,
joining a working group focused on Music and Code in Performance. In 2021 he
received the Basel Media Art Prize (Basler Medienkunstpreis) for p5.glitch and
was a Processing Foundation Teaching Fellow. In 2024 he was awarded a Swiss
Design Award in Media & Interaction Design for P5LIVE.
