Anna Xambó is an experimental electronic music producer and researcher. Biased for being passionate about extreme digital minimalism and a past performer
on bass guitar, she likes to explore the boundaries of digital sound focusing
on low frequencies, compulsive rhythms, and noisy textures. Her research and
practice concentrate on creating sound and music computing systems. To date,
she has released four solo albums: “init” (Carpal Tunnel, 2010), “On the Go”
(Carpal Tunnel, 2013), “H2RI” (Pan y Rosas, 2018) and “detuning a tuning”
(Carpal Tunnel, 2023). She is a Senior Lecturer in Sound and Music Computing
at the Centre for Digital Music, Queen Mary University of London. She is the
Principal Investigator of the AHRC-funded project “Sensing the Forest: Let
the Forest Speak using the Internet of Things, Acoustic Ecology and Creative
AI” (2023-2025) and has also led the EPSRC HDI Network Plus funded project
“MIRLCAuto: A Virtual Agent for Music Information Retrieval in Live Coding”
(2020-2021).
