Alicia Champlin is an American intermedial artist and researcher from Maine, based in
Barcelona since 2017. Her primary questions are about how generative systems and sound can be tools 
to pick at the phenomenological aspects of our systems-based paradigm, where co-experience & meaning 
are emergent phenomena. Her creative efforts take many forms - live-coding, sound baths, instrument building, 
biofeedback/biohacking, sound installation, durational performances etc, as well as finding interesting ways 
these practices can intersect - using whatever aesthetic vocabulary best suits the question at hand. A current
thread of inquiry is into self-regulating mechanisms, especially as applied to the experience
of trauma. 

Champlin received her MFA from the University of Maine and has performed or
exhibited with Sònar Festival, Cabaret Voltaire, Galeria Zé dos Bois, VIU Festival, BEK, IEM,
and ICLC.
