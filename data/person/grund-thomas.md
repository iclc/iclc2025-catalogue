MrReason (Thomas Grund) is a live coding musician, electric guitarist and software engineer from
Leipzig/Germany. He has actively contributed to the TidalCycles community since 2020. Noteworthy are the
development and release of TidalLooper, SuperDirtMixer, and TidalVST, widely used in diverse projects.
MrReason is constantly working on his idea of combining complex arrangements with live coding, guitar
playing and live looping to bring his own vision of a live performance to the stage. His music is, on the one
hand, highly influenced by modern guitarists like Plini and David Maxim Micic; on the other hand, it is
influenced by video game music from the past 25 years. He has also recently joined the Leipzig-based group
LOL2 (League of Livecoding Leipzig)
