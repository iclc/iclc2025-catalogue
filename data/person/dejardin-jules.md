After graduating a master's degree in computer musicology I
started to mainly use SuperCollider. I was expecting of this software a magical
freedom of synthesis: to be able to express an appropriate description of my
acoustics desires and make them real. While I’m still far from those expectations,
I fell in love with the small clues that I gather along the way and all these trails to
follow. I also spend time exploring speaker system crafting, sound spatialisation
which is an important part of our practice with Elie.
