Dimitris is one of infiniteMonkeys, aimlessly typing away at a keyboard. He
always heard people say that "music is maths", but he was confused by its
meaning and so he set out to find an answer for himself. Sharing time between
London and the Emute Lab, he develops and uses TimeLines, a live coding
language for expressing music as mathematical functions of time. His practice
focuses on live coding information rather than process; a hopeless attempt to stop
constantly building his instrument and start playing the damned thing. A
minimal setup and a focus on carefully cultivated, homemade randomness makes
every performance a unique trip through the infinite spacetime domain of the
computational universe. Dimitrisâ€™s practice is core to the development of the
uSEQ module.
