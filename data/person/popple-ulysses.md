Ulysses Popple came up through livecode.nyc in the late 2010s and is now a proud
member of Livecode LDN. He has always been fascinated with building systems -
starting with using Haskell and JavaScript to interface with TouchDesigner, then
livecoded AI with Arcadia and Unity's ML-Agents, and finally coming back around
to interfacing with THREE.js through a visual language tool. He's excited to share
this latest iteration of https://nodysseus.io/ with the community!
