Glen Fraser (CA) is a Barcelona-based software engineer/artisan who has worked in graphics, sound, interactive and immersive technology for three decades. Most of his professional life has been spent creating software tools for artists, collaborating directly with artists, and wondering whether to call himself an artist. His first foray into live coding was in 2013, and since 2019 he has been active with TOPLAP Barcelona, exploring musical/visual live coding and performing with tools of his own creation. Glen develops and uses Bacalao, his personal collection of live-coding tools for SuperCollider, and co-created the Animatron tool for live-coded “visual poetry” and animation.
