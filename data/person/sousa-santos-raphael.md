Sonologico (Raphael Sousa Santos) is a composer, visual artist and programmer
from the Northeast of Brazil based in the Netherlands. Using sounds from
traditional instruments, synthesizers, recordings, and audio processing, he uses
keyboard instruments, his own programs and live-coding to build soundscapes
that range from ethereal still harmonies to distorted pulsating noise. As a
composer, his music has been performed in concerts throughout Brazil. As a
performer (both solo and as part of an ensemble), he has performed audiovisual
electronic pieces in independent concerts and in events and locations such as
the GOGBOT festival, the Oude Muziek Utrecht festival, WORM, and the
Orgelpark. He has also performed and produced visual pieces and projections in
collaboration with musicians or presented in fixed media.
