I was captured by generative music four years ago
(after a journey through the philosophy of technology and software development)
and I have since pursued a dual goal: to develop a livecoding environment
providing new possibilities I’d like to have at hand, and to offer captivating
performances. I often spatialize the music and I like to explore rich rhythms an
grooves, modulated melodic phrases, and the efficient assets of dance music. I’m
inspired by a variety of genres, and try to combine them in original ways offered
by algoritmic music.
