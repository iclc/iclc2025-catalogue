Ivó Valdivielso is a musician and sound researcher based in Barcelona with projects in
the fields of alternative rock, kosmische and experimental music. His style is influenced
by the geometric patterns of krautrock, the hypnotism of Jamaican dub, and the
abstraction of ambient music. His works revolve around social concepts and are linked
to local culture. Synthesizers, samplers and electroacoustic gear make up Ivo's sonic
palette. Solid background documentation and preliminary field recordings are key
elements in his creative process.
Ivo’s main projects are Can Ràbia (catchy melodies and krautrock beats), Les Eines
(experimental soundscapes and vintage electronics) and Refugi de Fauna Salvatge (live
coding and improvisation).
