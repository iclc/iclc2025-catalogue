Camilo Nemocón is a Colombian electronic artist who immerses himself in the creation of virtual and ephemeral environments, developing works and installations focused on experimentation with telematic technologies. He uses interactive devices as fundamental tools to generate pieces that reflect on technological and industrialized society. His work is deeply influenced by the Net Art of the 1980s and 1990s, allowing him to explore and question the relationship between human beings, technology, and art in the digital age.
