Dan Gorelick is an artist who uses classical instruments and computation to create sonic
experiences that connect people to themselves, each other, and the natural world. His work
explores how music, as a time-based medium, serves as a vehicle to appreciate
timescales—human, biological, geological—and to promote awareness of our relationship
with nature and climate. His practice draws inspiration from deep listening approaches,
exploring the meditative, healing, and connective nature of sound. Dan is based between
the Bay Area and New York City, and gives talks and workshops on the creative possibilities
of technology. He is a member of the Art & Code NEW INC Year 10 and 11 cohort. He is a
founding member of the San Francisco / Bay Area art collective, AV Club and is an organizer
of LivecodeNYC.
