Bruno Gola is a Brazilian artist, programmer and computer musician based in Berlin. He studied Computer Science and worked as sysadmin and programmer for many years before shifting his research to Art and Media and focusing on artistic output. His practice is built around developing DIY open source systems for live audio-visual improvisation and interactive installations, playing around concepts of agency, interaction and liveness and including elements of live coding, free improvisation and live electronics. Apart from making his own instruments and software, he develops tools for other artists and regularly collaborates with code for open source projects. Since 2023 he works as assistant professor in the Generative Kunst / Computational Arts class at the Berlin University of the Arts and often teaches seminars and workshops in the context of computational arts and sound art.
