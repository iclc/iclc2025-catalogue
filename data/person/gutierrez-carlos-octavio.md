Carlos Octavio Gutiérrez (Toluca, Mexico. 1983). He holds a Bachelor's degree in Communication and a Master's degree in Music (with a specialization in Music Technology). He is currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Musicology. As a university professor, he has taught subjects such as Sound Art, Interactive Art, and Creative Coding, focusing his academic interests on music production, algorithmic art, and free software.

In 2010, he received the State Youth Award (EDOMEX) in the short film category. He has been awarded funding for artistic creation through the PECDA program twice (2014 and 2019) in the categories of alternative media and musical improvisation.
