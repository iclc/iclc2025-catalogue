eerie_ear/Sebastian Pappalardo is a sound designer and digital artist. His
multimedia project eerie_ear explores audio visual generative art, using live
coded interactivity to create sound and pixel synthesis, audio signal and sample
processing through a prism of multiplicity, feedback, geometry, glitch-art and
noise manipulation. Motivated to contribute to the creation of a more holistic
approach in the arts and technology landscape, he focuses his music and video
production process on the concept of “systems of growth”. In a passionate and
mindful conversation with generative algorithms, his art evolves in haphazard
rhythms and intervals, inspired by timbres and tensions present in abstract art,
contemporary composition and cinematic sound design. He produces challenging
and intricate acousmatic sonorities, some such experiments combine granular
synthesis tidalcycles functions with dreamy midi devices, to create complex multiinstrument sound textures and patterns. Sebastian is also an AV professional,
specialized in film sound post-production, and an educator, focusing on media
in the context of socio-cultural environments and the relation between the
audiovisual and educational processes.
