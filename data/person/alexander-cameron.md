Cameron Alexander is an artist, programmer, and scientist based in New York. He is interested in the implications the tools we use have on what we create and the aesthetics that emerge from the spaces in between. His work explores these spaces and draws parallels to the relationship between math and nature (especially in chaos, cybernetics, and fractals), esoteric states of consciousness, and the essence of reality. Cameron primarily operates with experimental media such as interactive installations, live coded audiovisual performances, and alternative-process photography.

Cameron is a member of the New York-based collective livecode.nyc, where he organizes shows, gives livecoding workshops, and performs live coded visuals and music at algoraves. Cameron is involved in community building, education, curation, and creating sustainable alternative structures of power.
