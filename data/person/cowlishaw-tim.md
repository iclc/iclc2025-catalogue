Tim Cowlishaw (London, 1983) is a researcher, designer, and technologist,
currently enrolled in the PhD programme in the DARTS group at the Universitat
Oberta de Catalunya, where he is investigating the materiality and ecology of
digital waste, from a perspective that combines design research, STS, and the
environmental humanities, as well as an experimental musician working with
guitar, electronics and livecode. His work with livecode involves the manipulation
of electro-acoustic signals in real-time, and the invention of instruments and
effects to be used alongside other instruments. He has presented work at VIU
and Eufònic festivals, Sónar+D, CCCB, Medialab Matadero and the Museum of
the Moving Image, NYC.
