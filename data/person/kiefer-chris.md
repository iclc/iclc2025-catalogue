Chris performs under the name Luuma. He’s been playing livecoding gigs since
the early days of Algoraves in 2012, and has performed at several ICLC
conferences. Over this time he’s experimented with a variety of coding
instruments, from SuperCollider systems to Verilog and FPGAs to LISP and
modular synthesis. Outside of livecoding, Chris makes and plays hybrid
acoustic/electronic/digital feedback instruments, and performs with drone noise
act Brain Dead Ensemble. He has released music on Emute Lab, Confront
Recordings, Trestle Records, Silent Records, Chordpunch, Punish, Cryonica Music
and Wasp Factory. He has a forthcoming release on Flaming Pines.
