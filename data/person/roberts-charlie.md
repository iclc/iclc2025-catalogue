I am a performer and tool-maker who has been active in the live coding community
for the last decade. I primarily develop the live coding system gibber, but have
also created a number of other tools and libraries for computational expression.
My most recent work is the live coding language Screamer, for creating worlds
using the rendering technique of ray marching. I am currently an Associate
Professor of Computer Science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, where I also
teach in the Interactive Media and Game Development program.
