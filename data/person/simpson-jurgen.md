Jürgen Simpson is an Irish composer and curator working in diverse ways across wideranging contexts. His music embraces contrast and interdisciplinarity, engaging across the fields of film, dance and installation art. Though explorations of acoustic instruments and voice feature throughout his music, his dedication to ‘live electronics’ has been a central theme. Modular synthesis has been a key focus since the 1990’s, employed across his works for opera and dance as well as a decade performing with Dublin band “The Jimmy Cake”. 

His adaptation of Simeon Ten Holt’s “Canto Ostinato” for modular synthesis and SuperCollider was performed at New Music Dublin 2023. In 2013 established ‘Light Moves’, an interdisciplinary festival bridging dance, digital and screen-based practices. He has been located at the University of Limerick’s Digital Media and Arts Research Centre since 2004. His work has been supported widely including Arts Council of Ireland, British Council, Canada Council for the Arts.
