Gábor Ugray is a Berlin-based generative artist with a background in computer science and linguistics. He uses code as a medium to express visual ideas, alternating between solitary exploration and performative live coding. He produces purely digital works as well as algorithmically composed physical pieces. His work is rooted in a personal space of calm and focus where he retreats to create the visual algorithms underlying his art.
