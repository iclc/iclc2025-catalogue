I am a Boston, USA-based electronic musician, educator, and labor organizer who resignifies archaic tools and materials in real-time to reveal how gendered technologies mediate gendered labors. I value machines for their patience and their capacity to remember. 

I hold a B.Mus in French horn performance from the City University of New York (Copland School of Music); a MLIS in digital media from San Jos√© State University; a MA in music composition from Mills College; and a PhD in music composition and computer technologies from the University of Virginia. 

I am employed as an Assistant Professor of Electronic Production and Design | Creative Coding at the Berklee College of Music, and Vice President of Full-Time Faculty with MS1140 American Federation of Teachers Massachusetts.
