I am an improvising electronic musician, digital luthier, educator, and labor
organizer trained as an archivist who transparently resignifies archaic tools and
materials to reveal how gendered technologies mediate gendered labors. I often
focus on memory as a site of critical agency and accountability. I value machines
as musical instruments for their patience and their capacity to remember. In
my creative practice, I challenge how ‘authenticity’ is performed in the creation
of electronic musical instruments; how ‘virtuosity’ is performed on electronic
musical instruments; and how ‘genius’ is performed in institutional histories. I
am employed as an Assistant Professor of Electronic Production and Design |
Creative Coding at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.,
and Councilor with MS1140 American Federation of Teachers Massachusetts.
