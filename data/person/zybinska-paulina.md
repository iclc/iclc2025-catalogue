Paulina Zybinska is a creative technologist whose work spans the fields of coding, interactive installations, VJing, and projection mapping. She teaches and researches at the Zurich University of the Arts (ZHdK), where she investigates the potential applications of Deepfake technologies in the context of mental health therapy. In addition, Zybinska performs under the artist name "Krata", collaborating as a VJ with the Reckless Collective and curating live coding events with the unsorted.love collective. Since 2021, her practice has increasingly incorporated TouchDesigner, a software platform that enables her to merge art, technology, and machine learning in real-time performances.
