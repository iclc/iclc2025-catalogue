Bernat Romagosa is a software engineer at SAP. His job is to help develop the Snap! and MicroBlocks programming languages and to craft learning materials for people to learn about the power of creative computing. He's been mixing the physical and real worlds together since he started the Snap4Arduino project at the Citilab (Barcelona) in 2013.

His passion for computing revolves around live programming systems and pedagogy. One of his other passions is music, and when the sun sets, he mixes the two by live coding synthesizers with MicroBlocks in Barcelona whenever he has the chance.

No matter what, Smalltalk will forever be his favorite language.
