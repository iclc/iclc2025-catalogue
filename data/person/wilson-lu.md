Lu Wilson is a creative technologist from London with a background in teaching.
They make slightly surreal videos about their projects, often with heavy use of
recursion. Their other creations include the satirical language Dreamberd, the
experimental online gallery Torn Leaf, and a time-travel simulator for frogs. In
their spare time, they co-host the Future of Coding podcast with friends.
