Sol Sarratea is a programmer and computational artist based in Leipzig, who uses code as her
main language for creating visual narratives. By writing programs that run on the GPU, and
writing systems for these programs to run in, creates “code-traits”: portraits of code.

She is constantly looking for the expression in the medium, and generating the medium to
express. Is an active member of the livecoding community. For the last couple of years, she has
been building identity through feedback loops.

Currently performing as olquemals, third iteration of solquemal.
