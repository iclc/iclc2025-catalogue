Ramon Casamajó is a musician and educator with a long career in multiple projects,
always with a strong innovative and experimental flavour, as well as in different cultural
initiatives and collectives. His background is in computer engineering and music, and
has performed nationally and internationally.

His work explores a personal space between electronics, contemporary composition,
and experimental music, with room for free improvisation, seeking tension between
rhythm and abstraction, melody and noise, analog and synthetic.
