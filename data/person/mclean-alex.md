Alex McLean is a musician, software artist and researcher based in Sheffield UK,
working as research fellow as part of the independent, open access studio Then
Try This. His research explores ‘algorithmic patterns’, investigating heritage
algorithms across culture, and how they can inform the new technologies he makes
as part of his creative practice. Alex has been performing his own algorithmic
music since the year 2000, both solo and in a range of collaborations, including at
No Bounds, Glastonbury, Sonar, Club Transmediale, Ars Electronica, Sonic Acts
and Lovebytes festivals. He is an active organiser across the digital arts, including
co-founding and curating the AlgoMech festival of Algorithmic and Mechanical
Movement in Sheffield, co-founding the TOPLAP live coding and Algorave
algorithmic dance movements, and creating the TidalCycles and co-creating
the Strudel live coding environments. He co-edited the Oxford Handbook of
Algorithmic Music in 2018, and co-authored “Live Coding: A User’s Manual”
published open access in November 2022 by MIT Press.
