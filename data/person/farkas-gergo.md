Gergő F. Farkas (they/them) is a gathering of cells with a passion for choreography, dance, organisation, facilitation, romance and mischief. Being lost in Stockholm, Budapest, Vienna, or somewhere in between, they dream of belonging to sensual spaces where not only humans are invited to dance.

Their choreographic work has been presented in venues and festivals such as Trafó House of Contemporary Arts (HU), Dansehallerne (DK), Open House Festival (CY), MDT Legacy Festival (NL), Dansmakers Asterdam (NL), MDT Moderna Dansteatern (SE), amongst others. They are currently nominated for the ZKB Acknowledgement Prize (CH).

In season 2022-2023, Gergő was a resident artist at Creative Europe’s Performing Gender program and toured their piece Deep Fake as a part of the Aerowaves Twenty22 selection. In 2021, Gergő received the Dance Web Scholarship, under the mentorship of Frederic Gies and Anne Juren.
