Domenico Cipriani, a.k.a. Lucretio, has been producing raw minimalist dance
music for over a decade. Through various aliases and collaborations — most notably
with Blawan and Objekt — he has released more than 100 vinyl records and
performed in prominent European clubs.

After graduating from the S.A.E. Institute in Barcelona, he earned an M.A. in
Linguistics from the University of Padova, focusing on social semiotics. In 2016, he
discovered Symbolic Sound Kyma, participating annually in the Kyma International
Sound Symposium, where he explored the integration of Kyma with p5.js and gained
expertise in the Open Sound Control protocol.

In 2019, he presented an interactive performance based on network-distributed Open
Sound Control at the Sonic Experiments festival at ZKM. He also performed at the
Algorave hosted by ICLC24 in Shanghai. Currently, he is researching computer music
at the Pharo Association.
