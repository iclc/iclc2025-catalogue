Julia Múgica is a Mexican scientist and artist who currently focuses on exploring
complex processes in nature. With an interdisciplinary background that includes
undergraduate studies in biology, a master degree in psychology, and a Ph.D. in
computational physics, she is deeply interested in understanding how collectives make
decisions that result in behavioral synchrony. Recently, she has been dedicated to
creative coding, where the process of creation amplifies different aspects of the same
phenomenon. Julia’s work encompasses data analysis and visualization, modeling of
animated particles, designing sound based on algorithms of random motion, rhythm and
collective patterns using interactive robots, and artistic applications of voice
recognition. She teaches at the University of Barcelona, where she instructs on collective
behavior and complexity from a socio-computational perspective.
