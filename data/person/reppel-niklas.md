Niklas Reppel is (in no particular order) a programmer, live coder, sound artist, composer, musician, and committed eclecticist. He has been based in Barcelona since 2017, where he found a home in the local TOPLAP community. Coming from a multifaceted musical background that features everything from jammy rock bands to contemporary chamber music ensembles, his current live coding work prominently features improvisation (from-scratch live coding being his favourite discipline) and fluctuates between multichannel soundscapes, fieldcoding and piano music. He has performed as a live coder nationally and internationally, and has been a regular contributor to the International Conference on Live Coding since its inception in 2015.
