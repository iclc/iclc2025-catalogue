I am a Brazilian musician, sound designer and former journalist with a master's degree in
Net Art and Digital Culture and engaged in a PhD program in Artificial Humanity at the
Accademia di Belle Arti di Santa Giulia, Brescia (IT). My practice and research focus on the
boundaries of media, communication, technology, and sound as part of a transdisciplinar
practice. My work addresses themes such as data infrastructure and ethics, post-internet
structures of power and mass media industry, searching for a radical approach to
technology as a way of understanding the micro-realities ignored by the era of post-truth
and machine automatism. In this context I have created lixt: a presence that represents my
researchâ€™s path through the use of live coding as a medium for artistic expression. The
practical side of this broader research, an experimental playground created to expose and
explore the contemporary crisis of language.
