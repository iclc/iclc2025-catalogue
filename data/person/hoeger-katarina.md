Cougars Are Cats Too (Katarina Hoeger) is a flutist, live coder, and intermedia
artist. Her current preferred method of performing includes sampling her flute
live and using code to modify the sampled materials. She is interested in using
her artistic explorations to explore the relationships between entities existing
in proximity to one another, for example, to explore the way the existence of
visuals produced by this.xor.that influences her own live coded audio sets and
vice versa. Cougars Are Cats Too is based out of the New York City suburbs,
is a member of the artist collective LiveCode.NYC and is a founding member of
Music Community Lab. As a live coding artist, she has performed in New York
City and in Bangor, Maine.
