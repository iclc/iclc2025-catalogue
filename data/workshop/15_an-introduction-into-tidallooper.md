# $PROGRAM_NOTE

This workshop introduces live looping in a live coding environment using the TidalLooper library - a live
looper for TidalCycles, implemented in SuperCollider. Participants will learn how to set up the TidalLooper,
understand the basics of live looping, and experiment with musical ideas not easily achievable with
hardware alone. The workshop covers both replace and overdub modes of looping, demonstrating how to
record, manipulate, and playback audio in real-time. Participants will also explore controlling the looper with
code and external inputs such as MIDI and OSC, using a virtual interface and real devices like a MIDI
footboard. The session concludes with creative experiments, including manipulating loop lengths, creating
canon-like effects, and developing feedback loops for evolving soundscapes. Participants will gain practical
skills in live looping in a live coding environment, enabling them to start their own musical experiments.

# $ABSTRACT

This workshop provides an introduction to live looping in a live coding environment using the TidalLooper library - a live looper for TidalCycles implemented in SuperCollider. Participants will learn how to set up TidalLooper, understand the basics of live looping and experiment with musical ideas that are not easily realized with hardware alone. The workshop covers both the replace and overdub modes of looping and demonstrates how to record, manipulate and play back audio in real time. Participants will also explore controlling the looper with code and external inputs such as MIDI and OSC, using a virtual interface and real devices such as a MIDI footboard. The session concludes with creative experimentations, including manipulating loop lengths, creating canon-like effects and developing feedback loops for evolving soundscapes. Participants will gain practical skills in live looping in a live coding environment, enabling them to launch their own musical experiments.
