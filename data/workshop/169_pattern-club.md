# $PROGRAM_NOTE

Patterns are fundamental to live coding, connecting our code-based practice
to a long history of arts and crafts, including textile/fiber artists, bell ringers,
origamists and so on. This session will focus on the sharing and remaking of
patterns, exploring how they successfully (and unsuccessfully) can be translated
from one medium to another, and how the computer language at play has its
bearing on the resulting pattern when it is remade.
We will briefly introduce a range of patterns at the start of the workshop,
with participants encouraged to bring and share their own. We will then
take some time to re-make the patterns in different ways, e.g. by applying a
different computational paradigm and/or programming language, reimplementing
a handmade pattern in code (or vice-versa), or by translating a pattern from
one medium to another (perhaps creating a ‘remix chain’). We will then discuss
the outcomes in the round, reflecting on what pattern-based practice can bring
to live coding and vice-versa.

# $ABSTRACT

Patterns are fundamental to live coding, connecting our code-based practice to a long history of arts and crafts, including textile/fiber artists, bell ringers, origamists and so on. This session will focus on the sharing and remaking of patterns, exploring how they successfully (and unsuccessfully) can be translated from one medium to another, and how the computer language at play has its bearing on the resulting pattern when it is remade.

We will briefly introduce a range of patterns at the start of the workshop, with participants encouraged to bring and share their own. We will then take some time to re-make the patterns in different ways, e.g. by applying a different computational paradigm and/or programming language, reimplementing a handmade pattern in code (or vice-versa), or by translating a pattern from one medium to another (perhaps creating a 'remix chain'). We will then discuss the outcomes in the round, reflecting on what pattern-based practice can bring to live coding and vice-versa.

People have creatively explored algorithmic patterns together across multiple materials, developing procedures to extend their collective imaginations and developing practices and communities around them. It is hoped that by creating space for these communities to interact, we hoped that cross-pollination of understandings might form new insights and build pathways between less-explored conceptual framings.

The workshop will have open-ended goals, but we hope to generally contribute to live coding itself being a heritage technology, with techniques and ideas passed through both communities and generations.
