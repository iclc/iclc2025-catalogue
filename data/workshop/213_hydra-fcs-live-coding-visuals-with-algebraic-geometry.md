# $PROGRAM_NOTE

Hydra FCS is an extension to the Hydra video synthesizer for creating visual effects
with algebraic geometry. Participants will learn about different mathematical
representations of curves and surfaces in two, three, and even four dimensions, and
how to combine them to create rich, complex visuals effects. This workshop will also
urge participants to think critically about the roles of maps, modularity, and
representation in math, programming, and art.
