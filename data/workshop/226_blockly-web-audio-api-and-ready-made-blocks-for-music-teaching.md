# $PROGRAM_NOTE

Workshop contents:

1. Introduction to Blockly

4. Developing of those ideas using the Web Audio API.

# $ABSTRACT

Usually the approach to live coding music education only involves the description of a certain language and the technologies associated with the live coding practice. By reviewing tutorials of live coding, it is possible to find here and there, another kind of methodologies, like code examples or remakes of certain songs. In my research, I am collecting various approaches of teaching and learning music through live coding in order to create a live coding toolkit, a collection of music studios that work to develop the student's own musicianship to be presented in the form of Block-based custom made Ã©tudes of live coding.

For that reason, I would like to propose a workshop as a dedicated space for music educators that use code to teach music, to share together their successful methodologies in order to collect and share them with the international community of the ICLC. Together, we will review the creation of blocks using the Web Audio API and Blockly.
