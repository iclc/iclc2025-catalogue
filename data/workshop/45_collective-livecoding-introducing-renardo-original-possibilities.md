# $PROGRAM_NOTE

This workshop propose to livecode together by group of 3-4 people using Renardo
(FoxDot fork) and flok online editor. It will be a gentle enough introduction to
Renardo but will also present new livecoding possibilites in original directions
(DAW livecoding, Python+SCLang livecoding and metaprogramming
https://eliegavoty.xyz/docs/new-renardo-features).

# $ABSTRACT

Renardo is a relatively new FoxDot fork.
This workshop proposal is to first present some part of the classic syntax and possibilities of FoxDot/Renardo then introduce the new features of Renardo and see how we can use these to code music together.
Renardo first aims to maintain, simplify and clean the FoxDot codebase while keeping the whole feature set and language possibilities. Secondly it adds a whole range of new features to FoxDot.
These extends the livecoding possibilities in 3 directions :
• Livecoding a DAW (Reaper in this case) using FoxDot/Renardo syntax. You can control/pattern plugins and their parameters and somehow mix generative music with “mainstream” tools consistently.
• Reopen the possibilities of SuperCollider sound synthesis directly from Renardo code : this help enrich the instruments proposed by FoxDot or livecode supercollider directly from python file for crazy results.
• Leverage new metaprogramming possibilities ( writing code that triggers/automate livecoding in many ways ) for higher level/ longer period crafting of the music.
The details of this features with demo videos/code can be found here : https://eliegavoty.xyz/docs/new-renardo-features
We plan to use the flok online editor and 3 to 5 preinstalled computers (that we can bring) to which participants will connect by group of 3-4 people using their laptop. Based on our preceding workshops, this setup is more appealing and convivial than spending time installing the software at the beginning.
The workshop will insist on how to choose complementary generative music directions for the member in each group to play like a band.
Depending on the groups mood, we can have a small public jamming together as workshop final display.
