# $PROGRAM_NOTE

Wax is a free, open-source, browser-based audio synthesis environment accessible
to anyone with an internet connection. With the capabilities of modern phones,
it is possible to run highly complex, efficient, low-latency DSP routines directly
in the browser using Web Assembly and AudioWorklets. In this workshop, par-
ticipants will learn how to design their own audio synthesis algorithms in Wax,
which uses a flow-based programming paradigm similar to Max and Pure Data,
where the user adds and connects together devices in a workspace. Participants
will also learn how to record sessions to WAV files, modify sound with a phone’s
accelerometer, save and share system states with others, access connected mi-
crophones, and live code custom wavetabeles using Facet, a JavaScript-based
live-coding framework that is incorporated as a nested live-coding environment
via Wax’s “pattern” object.

# $ABSTRACT

Wax is a free, open-source, browser-based audio synthesis environment accessible to anyone with an internet connection. Wax empowers users to live code efficient, complex, low-latency audio synthesis algorithms running as AudioWorklets in the browser. Due to its basis as an entirely client-side web application with no software installation needed, Wax is versatile and can be used in various ad-hoc musical contexts. Especially on mobile devices, it enables spontaneous live coding of multi-channel sound and recording sessions on the go, offering new creative opportunities in situations where computers, microphones, hardware synthesizers, and keyboards would be difficult to set up.

Wax functions as a data-flow programming environment, akin to Pure Data and Max/MSP, where users create object graphs that generate and modify digital audio signals. Adding to these capabilities, Wax also features a nested live-coding environment through its "pattern" object, built on Facet, a JavaScript-based live-coding framework. This allows users to define complex and flexible musical structures within Wax without requiring a complete reconfiguration of the objects in the workspace.

Wax functions as not only a standalone audio programming environment for a range of users from novices to experts but also an affordable, metamorphic tool for extending a musical system without purchasing additional gear. With the ability to output up to 32 channels of audio, it is possible for a computer or mobile phone running Wax to function as a complex multi-channel instrument which can be paired with digital audio workstations or hardware synthesizers, opening up new capabilities and modes of interaction with one's existing tools (the abstract is continued in the attached PDF).
