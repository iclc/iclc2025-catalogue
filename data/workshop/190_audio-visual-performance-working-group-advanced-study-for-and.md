# $PROGRAM_NOTE

This workshop / working group explores creating browser-based audio-visual
performances using Strudel with integrated Hydra visuals. The goal is to share knowledge
on crafting performances that combine music with visuals, enhancing audience
appreciation of musical patterns through visual representation.
The format is a highly interactive working group, encouraging non-hierarchical knowledge
exchange. While there's an overall structure, the workshop allows for flexible learning and
sharing among participants. Techniques covered may include:
● Strudel note pattern techniques
● Intuitive use of MIDI Piano Roll
● Linking Hydra to Strudel sketches
● Using mouse movement as a visual controller
● Window capturing for visual sources
● Live performance tips and tricks
This workshop aims to equip participants with skills to create engaging audio-visual
performances, blending music creation with visuals for an immersive and pedagogical
audience experience.

# $ABSTRACT

This workshop / working group is an opportunity to explore creating browser-based audio-visual sets, leveraging the integration of Hydra living within Strudel. The goal of the workshop is to share knowledge on ways to create performances with Strudel that can also offer a visual element that serves the music that is being created.
The goal of creating visuals alongside the music is to offer another angle of pedagogy during the performance – allowing audiences to better appreciate the patterns that are inherent in the music.
The format for the workshop is intended to be a highly interactive working group, where there will be an overall flow offered, but that knowledge can be exchanged in a non-hierarchical way within the room. Different techniques that will be covered, but that we are not limited to:
Strudel note pattern techniques
Using MIDI Piano Roll in intuitive ways
Linking Hydra to the Strudel sketch
Integrating mouse movement as an expressive controller for visuals
Window capturing different sources for the visuals
Live-Performance tips and tricks
