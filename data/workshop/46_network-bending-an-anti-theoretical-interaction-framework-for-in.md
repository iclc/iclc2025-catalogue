# $PROGRAM_NOTE

Reed Ghazala’s concept of circuit bending transforms electronic devices into
“living instruments” with new, unpredictable behaviours. This workshop extends
that philosophy into network bending, applying it to generative neural networks
for sound design, live performance, and experimental sound art.
Participants will explore intuitive manipulation of open-source neural networks
without needing deep technical expertise. Like circuit bending, network bending
embraces unpredictability and creative disruption, encouraging participants to
subvert conventional design and sound aesthetics. The workshop emphasizes
accessibility by using small, interpretable, and computationally efficient networks
trained on personal sound recordings.
Participants will gain hands-on experience with network bending techniques,
training neural networks online or locally, and experimenting with tools like Pure
Data to produce unconventional sounds. This approach fosters an open, anti-
design methodology, allowing for experimentation beyond traditional boundaries
and challenging familiar aesthetics in sound creation.

# $ABSTRACT

Reed Ghazala, one of the most prominent circuit bending pioneers, proposes that once we intervene in device's original circuit design, it becomes a "living instrument" with a set of new agencies, affordances and behaviours [1]. How can this idea be translated to the domain of digital instruments? The workshop offers a deep dive into network bending, a technique inspired by the established practice of circuit bending, applied to the digital realm of generative neural networks. It offers artists and enthusiasts from diverse backgrounds to explore manipulation of open source artificial neural networks for sound design, live performance, and sound art.

Circuit bending is an iconic audio production and sound design technique dating back to the 60s, whose main premise is to rewire the original purpose of electronic circuit design capable of producing sound, in a way that leads to unexpected and creative output [2]. The practice offers a way to question and ultimately subvert the given state of things, without the necessity of becoming an expert in the domain beforehand. Central to it is the concept of “immediate canvas”. In the context of electronic design, it means that the modifications can be made intuitively, experimentally, and without a deep insight into the working of the hacked circuit. Such an approach can be interpreted as an anti-design practice, meaning that instead of reinforcing commonly accepted design goals and methodologies, it encourages free experimentation, unconstrained creativity and the embracement of uncertainty, which results in a production of glitch: an object from the fringe of the compositional thought, conventionally considered undesirable and redundant. The framing of network bending presented within the context of ICLC is a nod towards this anti-design approach, understood as a spiritual ancestor of the classical technique of circuit bending.
