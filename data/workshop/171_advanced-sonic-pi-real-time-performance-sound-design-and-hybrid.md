# $PROGRAM_NOTE

This advanced Sonic Pi workshop explores real-time performance, sound design,
and hybrid setups for experienced users. Participants will learn to structure
dynamic live sets, edit code on-the-fly, and use advanced tools like ring and array
structures to create intricate musical patterns. The workshop also covers using
conditional logic and probability to introduce controlled randomness into
performances, as well as integrating Sonic Pi with external hardware and software
using OSC (Open Sound Control). Attendees will gain hands-on experience building custom synths in SuperCollider and automating real-time FX chains to
craft immersive soundscapes. Designed for musicians, sound artists, and live
coders, this session focuses on practical applications and creative exploration,
equipping participants to push the boundaries of live coding. By the end of the
workshop, attendees will have the skills to create complex, interactive
performances that bridge the gap between Sonic Pi and external gear.

# $ABSTRACT

This workshop, **Advanced Sonic Pi: Real-Time Performance, Sound Design, and Hybrid Setups**, is designed for experienced users to explore Sonic Pi’s advanced capabilities in live coding, sound design, and performance. Over the course of four hours, participants will learn to structure and layer real-time music, utilizing buffers for on-the-fly code editing, and ring and array structures to create evolving rhythmic and melodic patterns. The workshop emphasizes the use of threads and patterns for managing multiple musical ideas simultaneously, fostering rich, layered compositions.

Participants will explore how to incorporate conditional logic and probability to introduce controlled randomness into musical sequences, enabling algorithmic compositions. The session will also cover integration with external hardware and software via OSC (Open Sound Control), allowing hybrid setups that connect Sonic Pi with tools like Ableton Live and SuperCollider, as well as MIDI controllers and synthesizers. A significant focus will be on sound design, including creating custom synths in SuperCollider and automating effects chains for dynamic performances.

By the end of the workshop, participants will have a comprehensive understanding of Sonic Pi’s advanced features and how to apply them in live performance contexts. The hands-on format encourages practical application, allowing participants to immediately implement the techniques in real-time performance. This workshop is ideal for musicians, sound artists, and live coders looking to push their Sonic Pi skills to the next level. It challenges participants to explore new creative possibilities, deepening their understanding of live coding as an artistic medium. With a focus on practical application, innovative techniques, and hybrid setups, this workshop empowers participants to expand the boundaries of what’s possible with Sonic Pi.
