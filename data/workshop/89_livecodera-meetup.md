# $PROGRAM_NOTE

LivecoderA is a live coding community that emerged in response to the need for recognizing
a specific group of live coders who identify as women. The group is inherently feminist and
intersectional, and its formation was driven by various motivations: solidarity and visibility, to
be counted as sisters, and to reflect to each other the strength of our numbers. The
community has since developed a manifesto and organized several events. It maintains an
active online presence, while also seeking to strengthen in-person connections through
coordinated gigs, residencies, and meetups. At this particular meetup, the community will
come together to exchange experiences and develop strategies aimed at promoting diversity
within the live coding community.
