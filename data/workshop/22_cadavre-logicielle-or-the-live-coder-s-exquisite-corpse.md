# $PROGRAM_NOTE

This workshop will focus on the surrealist parlour game ‘Exquisite Corpse’ and
some of its variations in different media. After creating some exquisite corpses
with pen and paper, the new live-coding system Cadavre Logicielle - an adaptation 
of the game to the medium of code - will be introduced and some possibilities it provides explored. 
Within this frame we will discuss other playful approaches and the role of play in live-coding. 
Finally we will think about the type of liveness that is inherent to games and ludic activities

# $ABSTRACT

The conversational art of Antje Eske and Kurd Alsleben is often seen as a strong influence on the early days of live-coding. Nowadays, this influence is probably most apparent in networked, improvisational live-coding performances, often emphasizing ludic interactions and collaborations that could be described as play. Games are in fact one of the most important practices of conversational art which sees its own roots in the French salon culture of the 17th and 18th centuries through to Dadaism and Surrealism. In this workshop we will focus on a popular game developed and practiced by the surrealists, the 'Cadavre Exquis', or 'Exquisite Corpse'. The rules of the game are simple: the players take turns to write a sentence on a piece of paper and hide part of the sentence by folding the paper before passing it on to the next player. In the end, the story is unfolded and read out loud. The game has also been adapted to other media, most notably to drawing. After creating some written and drawn exquisite corpses, the new live-coding system 'Cadavre Logicielle' - an adaptation of the game to the medium of code - will be introduced. Here, players take turns defining variables and sharing their name and type with the other players, while keeping the underlying expression hidden. This operation can be seen as the fold in the original game. All definable expressions in the system are instances of patterns from the live-coding language TidalCycles. This allows for a special type of unfolding of the final expression: listening to it. Towards the end of the workshop we will discuss the role of play in live-coding generally and think about what type of liveness is inherent to games.
