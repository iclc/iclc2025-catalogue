# $PROGRAM_NOTE

The LCAN SB3 (Live Coding Animated Notation in a Shared Browser-Based Buffer)
workshop is an opportunity for programmers and musicians of any level to learn about the
possibilities of creating live-coded Animated Musical Notation (AMN) in real-time.
Participants will need to connect to the internet from their laptop using any operating
system and browser. LCAN SB3’s language (TOML) has minimal syntax and grammar
requirements, making it quick and easy to learn and use. During the course of the
workshop participants will learn the basics of AMN, how to create and use LCAN SB3 for
AMN, and finally, share their compositions for everyone to perform. It is not required to
bring or even know how to play an instrument or how to program. In other words,

The LCAN SB3 (Live Coding Animated Notation in a Shared Browser-Based Buffer) workshop is an opportunity for programmers and musicians of any level to learn about the possibilities of creating live-coded Animated Musical Notation (AMN) in real-time. Participants will need to connect to the internet from their laptop using any operating system and browser. LCAN SB3’s language (TOML) has minimal syntax and grammar requirements, making it quick and easy to learn and use. During the course of the workshop participants will learn the basics of AMN, how to create and use LCAN SB3 for AMN, and finally, share their compositions for everyone to perform. Attendees will also be encouraged to collaborate via the shared buffer system built into the LCAN SB3. It is not required to bring or even know how to play an instrument or program. A variety of small percussion instruments will be provided.

For a 2-hour workshop, this is the proposed schedule:
30 minutes: explanation and setup of LCAN SB3
30 minutes: individual and guided exploration of LCAN SB3
60 minutes: group conversation, sharing and "performance" of sketches created with LCAN SB3
