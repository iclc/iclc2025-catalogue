# $PROGRAM_NOTE

Algorithmic Artscapes is a workshop that uses scores as seeds for distributed community
creativity providing the possibility to interact with other people in the context of creating
audio and/or video with multiple live coding mini languages, libraries and interaction
design. It also allows the participants to embed AI and machine learning algorithms in their
own way. These algorithms can be trained and used on-the-fly as part of people’s
interpretation of the scores.

# $ABSTRACT

Algorithmic Artscape is a work-in-progress web-platform which contains two components:
A set of programming languages and other tools for live coding audio and visuals which also includes an interface to train machine learning models on gesture recognition using camera, trackpad, mouse, keyboard, and mic. These models can be trained on-the-fly and embedded into the live coding performance.
A set of scores to inspire artistic creation either by making use of the tools above or external tools such as video and audio recording, writing, dance, photography.
The web-platform also contains an online art gallery with artistic contributions.


Workshop Aspirations:
• learn about the platform;
• exchange tricks, techniques and knowledge among participants;
• produce code sketches and scores (translated to sound, images and/ or videos which can be exhibited in the online gallery space);
• in addition participants will be invited to join the performance included in the program;
