# $PROGRAM_NOTE

Learn methodologies for collaboratively coding music using one editor in Flok! You will work in duos
and focus on communicating and listening to the musical output while editing the code together.
Working together will spark new ideas and give great insights in each others coding style. Lina &
Timo will hand out short exercises for collaborative coding practices and will demonstrate how they
approach collaborating with code themselves. We will end the workshop with a short open-stage
where the groups are invited to live code music in front of the other participants to showcase their
collaborative coding performance in a supportive environment. Languages that are supported in
Flok are Foxdot, Mercury, Renardo, Sardine, SClang, Strudel and Tidal. We will form duos based
on the languages used.
