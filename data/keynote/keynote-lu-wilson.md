"I am not dead yet" is a personal reflection on liveness as a way of being â€” a journey through creative coding, change, and learning in real time.

I am not dead yet, but one day I will be. Until then, I am a living thing that can respond and change and learn. 
I want to make the most of that, so I think it's best to do things "live" while I still can. And I'm still learning how to do that best.
What I can do is share my personal journey towards liveness in my own creative work. This is the story of how and why I do things live: Live.
