"All the screen’s a stage. Coding as performance" explores the liveness of live coding through the lens of performance and worldmaking.

The question of liveness is key to the artistic practice of live coding. But how does the concept of liveness refer to coding in a broader sense? 
The eventful and accelerated temporalities of our exhausted present predate on the ideas of immediacy and responsiveness in order to cast the 
capitalist spell we live under. Performance has become the medium and strategy by which our subjectivities come to be. In this keynote, 
I will raise the question of how coding is experiencing a shift from the paradigm of producing to that of performing, and what critical 
performance studies can tell us about the liveness of live coding.
