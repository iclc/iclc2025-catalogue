"Liveness as an Open Work: An Ongoing Live-Coding Algorithmic Journey" will be a reflection 
on liveness in live coding as an evolving artistic and technological practice, 
moving across physical/digital spaces and human/non-human interactions.

We currently live with an excess of information, in a time that keeps accelerating and on a multiplicity of spaces (physical, virtual, hybrid). The anthropologist Marc Aug√© talked about supermodernity and coined the term "non-places" to refer to the advent of transient environments with no socio-cultural imprint such as airports, highways, or shopping malls.

Live coding emerges in this accelerated world of places and non-places where traditional notions of space and time are challenged. The code-based practice can be seen as an artistic tool of enquiry and experimentation, which can take the pulse of socio-technological development and test new models of community organisation. Focusing on the performance act and the related development of live-coding tools and experiences, liveness can be seen as its heartbeat.

This talk will present a personal journey reflecting on liveness that started in the early days of live coding in Barcelona as part of a community of makers connected to an international network of DIY artist-coders. Narrated as an open and undetermined work, this presentation will discuss liveness through examples that move from physical to digital places, from tangible to intangible matter, and from human to non-human actors. The attempt will be to understand the role of liveness in live coding in a century of exponential growth and complexity.
