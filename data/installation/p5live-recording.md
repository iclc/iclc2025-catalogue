# $PROGRAM_NOTE

In 2021, P5LIVE, a collaborative live-coding vj environment for p5.js, introduced a new feature called RECODING. This feature allowed for the recording of a live-coding performance, tracking every keystroke and successful compile, with the ability to playback and save this data for future remix potential. The driving motivation of this feature was to track the dynamic and volatile process of live-coding, where decisions are quickly made and visual changes occur constantly. One can playback this file, scrub through the best moments and continue to code during what might later be thought of as a branch to continue developing.
