# $PROGRAM_NOTE

.abstraction().minified() is an interactive installation about live coding. A system consists of different functions (abstractions) and by combining them, they generate an output more complex than the sum of the parts. The visitor "codes" the artwork by adjusting knobs. This raises questions about what live coding is. Is adjusting parameters in highly abstracted functions live coding? Is abstraction making the code more accessible, or obfuscating underlying algorithms? Is a performance with this installation live coding? The artwork is available online so everyone can learn, remix, transform this version.
