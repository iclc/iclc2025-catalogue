# $PROGRAM_NOTE

Life Codes is an immersive installation that invites audiences to create generative music and visuals through live coding. The piece is divided into three acts and explores the themes of life, transformation, and interconnectedness. Through simple interaction, the installation demystifies live coding and makes it accessible to all. It uses SuperCollider for music generation and Animatron for visual creation, reflecting the values of the live coding community: collaboration, transparency, and the celebration of creativity as a shared experience. The installation was originally conceived for three projected walls and quadraphonic audio.

Produced by EPFL Pavilions in Lausanne for the exhibition Musica ex Machina, where it is still on display until June 29, 2025.
