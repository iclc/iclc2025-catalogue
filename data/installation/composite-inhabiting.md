# $PROGRAM_NOTE

Composite is a hybrid ecosystem of biotic and abiotic organs. The coexistence and intractions of plants, algorithms, fungi, speakers, compost, humans, and other organs build this evolving and living environment. The presence of algorithmic organs that affect and are affected within this intimate environment help us embody our radical eco-dependence and interdependence. The algorithms, in symbiosis with viewing organs, listening organs, painting organs, sound organs, dance organs, touch organs and many others, change their behaviour through organic “life coding” interfaces. Other organs will sense these changes and react to them, dancing in reciprocity a choreography of life.
