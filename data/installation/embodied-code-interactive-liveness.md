# $PROGRAM_NOTE

Embodied Code, Interactive Liveness explores the liminal space between body, code, interaction, and presence, dissolving the boundaries between programmer and participant. 
The work transforms movement into a tangible expression of algorithmic creativity. With it, it aims at drawing the visitor’s attention, inviting them to engage with live coding through embodied interaction. The installation explores a series of interaction strategies to make live coding accessible to the wider public by appealing to different visitor profiles—from newcomers to experienced developers—each encouraged according to their own expertise. In order to achieve this, interaction is structured in three layers: first, users can interact with the piece through bodily gestures and a physical button interface; second, they can experiment by editing small code fragments that will affect the visuals and sound, in order to start understanding the inner workings of the code; or, third, they can fully rewrite the core algorithms to generate a new live coding session in real time.
