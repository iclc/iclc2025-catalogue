# $PROGRAM_NOTE

Cyborg Cycles are dynamo-controlled coding bicycles. While pedaling you can generate sound and visuals.

The interface is a computer keyboard attached to the front handlebars of the bicycle. Use it to code music and images from scratch as long as your endurance lasts.

Buffer capacitors enable a quick switch between riders - donâ€™t let the Raspberry crash!

Pedal, code, and play!
