# $PROGRAM_NOTE

Incidental Effects [c4, c5, c6] evolves Giuseppe Torre’s previous series of live coding
performance that explore the displaced relationship between code and (artistic) self.
Gestural affordances provided by computer code are recognized as an unequivocal trace of
artistic self and are here further explored with a second performer, Jürgen Simpson. In this
new version, the original series’ focus on minimal technology and sonic material is
enhanced by interconnecting hybrid analogue/ digital layers in which both code and CV
synthesis respond to Torre’s digitally generated outputs. The materiality of the algorithmic
output (temporal and timbral) is shaped across multiple artistic selves. Liveness, then, is
distributed across systems and performers, involving divergent creative histories and
intersecting methodologies.
