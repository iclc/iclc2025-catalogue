# $PROGRAM_NOTE

Incidental Effects [c4, c5, c6] evolves Giuseppe Torre’s (aka handsandnumbers) previous series of live coding
performance that explore the displaced relationship between code and (artistic) self.
Gestural affordances provided by computer code are recognized as an unequivocal trace of
artistic self and are here further explored with a second performer, Jürgen Simpson. In this
new version, the original series’ focus on minimal technology and sonic material is
enhanced by interconnecting hybrid analogue/ digital layers in which both code and CV
synthesis respond to Torre’s digitally generated outputs. The materiality of the algorithmic
output (temporal and timbral) is shaped across multiple artistic selves. Liveness, then, is
distributed across systems and performers, involving divergent creative histories and
intersecting methodologies.

# $ABSTRACT

This proposal builds upon Giuseppe Torre’s series of live coding performances entitled “0 -
Incidental Effects”. This series explores the displaced relationship between code and
(artistic) self in which the gestural affordances provided by computer code are recognized
as an unequivocal trace of artistic self . This proposal introduces a second performer,
Jürgen Simpson, enabling an expansion of the original series’ focus on minimal technology
and sonic material by interconnecting a hybrid analogue/ digital layer in which both code
and CV synthesis respond to Torre’s digitally generated outputs.
The compositional strategies presented gravitate around the utilisation of constraint, in
both technology and timbral range, to return focus on ownership of gesture. Whereas the
original series developed around reduced materials, this version retains the gestural focus
whilst expanding its timbral set. These are manipulated live within a structured
improvisational framework driven by computer code. Torre’s work here will retain its
focus on the FOSS software with trigger impulses and sound materials further handled by
Simpson’s hybrid system where a monome Teletype and i2c connected system is the
primary instrument.

Jürgen Simpson has been working with live electronic music since the mid 1990’s using
modular systems and digital systems extensively across a range of settings. His work with
code in a live context emerged in his practice more recently and he has integrated both
TidalCycles and monome Teletype within his practice, presenting works that explore both
time-structures and timbre with a priority on real-time manipulation and control. His work
with Torre leverages recent cross-genre engagements (ranging from electronic dance
music festivals to concert listening situations), and will in particular explore the
opportunity of a network and voltage interconnected performance situation.
In line with the “liveness” theme of ICLC 2025, this performance invites a reflection on the
manners and forms in which the simultaneous deployment of a diverse set of live coding
paradigms hybridises ex-tempore their relationship. The materiality of the algorithmic
output (temporal and timbral) is shaped across multiple artistic selves. Liveness, then, is
distributed across systems and performers, involving divergent creative histories and
intersecting methodologies.
