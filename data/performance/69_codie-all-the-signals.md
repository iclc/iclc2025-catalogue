# $PROGRAM_NOTE

Codie is a live coding collective, making music and visuals. Our performances are
A/V shows will electronic sounds and video projections. We perform by creating our
works live and anew for each performance. Our sounds are dancey and our graphics
are SoCal. Sarah’s visuals are coded with her own Clojurescript-Electron app called La
Habra. She creates patterns and abstract shapes that animate and move to the rhythm.
Kate creates sound in the Ruby-based environment Sonic Pi. She manipulates and
layers samples with algorithms to create the soundtrack.
We type and improvise as we go, reacting to each other’s output and the audience’s
reactions. In accordance with the Live Coding Draft Manifesto, we project our code as
we go, so the audience can inspect and marvel at the changes and accumulations.
Codie has played across the world and the internet at Algoraves, conferences, galleries
and other events.
