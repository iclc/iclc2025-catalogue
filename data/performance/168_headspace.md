# $PROGRAM_NOTE

In this project, HeadSpace, the performerâ€™s live EEG data is used as a control signal, focuses
on the naturally occurring octaves (frequency doubling) within the EEG signal spectrum. As
a means of sonifying the brainwave signals, they will be mapped into a sequence of audible
frequencies through live coded sound synthesis, and stepped through a modulating
harmonic series derived from Schumann resonance frequencies. The two domains (EEG
and the Schumann resonance) essentially overlap in the electromagnetic spectrum, posing
an interesting synchronicity and thought experiment.
Through this pairing, manipulated by live-coding 40 individual synthesizers and
programmatically mixing the signals in real time, the work brings 2 omnipresent but
hidden phenomena together in a soundscape narrative of biofeedback in play with
atmospheric feedback.
