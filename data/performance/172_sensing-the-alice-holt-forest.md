# $PROGRAM_NOTE

This data-driven live coding performance explores natural soundscape recordings
from the Alice Holt Forest, UK, captured continuously over the course of a year
via a custom-built audio streamer and uploaded to the Freesound database. The
central enquiry is whether patterns in forest soundscapes can be linked to climate
change, using acoustic ecology and live coding to highlight their interconnection.
Are species’ sounds diminishing? Do environmental noises dominate? Are there
other acoustic markers tied to climate shifts? The performance uses MIRLCa, a
self-developed SuperCollider extension that combines AI and music information
retrieval (MIR) techniques to retrieve and manipulate sounds from Freesound
in real time. This performance is part of the broader project, “Sensing the
Forest: Let the Forest Speak using the Internet of Things, Acoustic Ecology,
and Creative AI,” (sensingtheforest.github.io) funded by the UKRI Arts and
Humanities Research Council (AH/X011585/1, AH/X011585/2).
