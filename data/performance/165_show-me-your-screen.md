# $PROGRAM_NOTE

An audiovisual performance by Eloi el Bon Noi and Turbulente, a session with

a high dose of IDM, glitch, feedback loops, humor and a prominent role for im-
provisation and interplay between sound and visuals. The visible code produces

both image and sound, but more importantly, like a game of infinite feedback
loops, Turbulente begins with his partner’s code-filled screen and uses it to
generate audio-reactive textures and visual narratives. “Show me your screen”

incorporates the presence of the artists’ bodies on stage, as well as the gadgets,
cables, cameras, and lights—those artifacts that are part of the live setup. Eloi
and Turbulente use humor to shift the audience’s attention to their amplified

gestures, the movements they make to manipulate code and play with the arti-
facts that they use. This performance is about code manipulating code, sound

creating visual choreographies, and overlapping screens overlapping code.
