# $PROGRAM_NOTE

The audio-visual live coding improvisation 46.875 explores audio synthesis to
simultaneously shape both sound and visuals. Sound is synthesized and played
back to the audience, while for each video frame (typically 60 frames per second),
a slice of the generated audio data is represented as a thin bar with brightness
corresponding to its amplitude. The visual representations for each audio channel
are arranged side by side on the screen.
The title 46.875 comes from the fundamental frequency of this piece, which is
derived from the audio sample rate (48,000 Hz) divided by the texture size on
the GPU (1024 pixels), which in my code is assigned to ~r for convenience. This
number is essential, as a periodic waveform with this frequency appears static in
the visuals, its wavelength matching the texture size. Slight changes in frequency
may have minimal impact on the sound but cause the visual representation
to move, while significant changes in sound may only slightly alter the visuals.
What excites me as a performer is exploring these phenomena and the inherent
audio-visual coupling within this constrained performance setup. I hope it
resonates with the audience as well.
