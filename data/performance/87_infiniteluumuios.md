# $PROGRAM_NOTE

Infiniteluumuios experiments with integrating live coding and modular synthesis within a
two-way improvisation, sharing voltages alongside bytes. Live coding and modular
synthesis differ in many ways, especially in their interaction paradigms and approaches to
precision, but they also share many commonalities in creating and manipulating signals—
after all, both are different but complementary substrates for time-varying
(re)computation of time-varying behaviours.

This performance uses the uSEQ live coding module to bridge the gap between these
worlds of discrete and continuous flows of electrical charges. Through typing and retyping
code, patching and repatching cables, gesturing, sliding, twisting, and toggling, this hybrid
computer—composed as much of cells and neurons as of voltages and logic gates—will
improvise the movements of speaker cones and human bodies.
