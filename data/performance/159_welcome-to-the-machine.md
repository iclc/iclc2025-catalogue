# $PROGRAM_NOTE

In 1975, Pink Floyd released Wish You Were Here, featuring Welcome to the
Machine, a critique of the dehumanizing effects of the music industry and
modern society. Fifty years later, as artificial intelligence reshapes industries
and creativity, we pay tribute to this classic by exploring large language models
(LLMs) in live coding.

This reinterpretation involves a live-coded music and visuals performance
using SuperCollider, where a human also interacts with an AI model—"The
Machine." Visuals generated with Animatron illustrate the feedback loop
between digital and material elements, enhancing the theme of hybridization.
This piece invites reflection on the real-time creation process, questioning the
nature of authorship and the role of AI as an active collaborator in
contemporary creativity.

# $ABSTRACT

Our piece is a tribute to Pink Floydʼs Welcome to the Machine, as well as a
reflection on the evolving relationship between human creativity and machine
intelligence. Through a live coding dialogue between human performer and AI,
we invite the audience to consider the role of technology not only as a tool but
as an active participant in the creative process, raising questions about the
future of human-machine collaboration.

In 1975, Pink Floyd released Wish You Were Here, one of their most acclaimed
albums. It featured the song Welcome to the Machine, composed by Roger
Waters, which prominently features synthesizers and processed sound. The
song served as a critique of the dehumanizing effects of the music industry
and modern society, exploring themes of alienation, control, and the loss of
individuality in an increasingly mechanized world. The music video, animated
by Gerald Scarfe, depicted desolate industrial landscapes, disturbing imagery,
and a machine symbolized by a monolithic structure, evoking a sense of cold,
mechanical oppression.

Fifty years later, as artificial intelligence becomes central to our world through
its exponential adoption, we are witnessing a new wave of automation that is
reshaping industries, displacing jobs, and transforming the creative process
itself. In response to this, we pay tribute to the visionary Welcome to the
Machine by reflecting on the use of large language models LLMs) in the
creative process, specifically within the context of live coding, raising
questions about the nature of authorship, and the role of AI in in contemporary
creativity.

Our reinterpretation of this classic piece features a live-coded music and
visuals performance. The music is generated using SuperCollider,
complemented by a secondary ReactJS interface we have developed for this
project, where a human performer interacts with an AI model, referred to as
The Machine. The performance represents a dialogue between human intention
and software agents, pushing the boundaries of creativity when algorithms and
AI act as co-creators.

The visuals, generated using Animatron—a visual poetry experimental
environment created by Roger Pibernat and Glen Fraser— will illustrate this
dialogue by representing the continuous feedback loop between digital and
material elements, blending abstract forms with mechanical imagery, adding
another layer of hybridization.

By embedding AI into the live coding process, we explore the real-time
creation in both its cultural and technical dimensions. The AI-driven system
serves as a live participant, shaping the music and visuals in real time based on
the coder's input, but also introducing an element of remoteness—reflecting
the increasing role of algorithms and intelligent processes in shaping our
everyday lives and cultural outputs. This is not only a technical challenge but
also a conceptual one, inviting us to rethink the nature of performance,
interaction, and embodiment in live coding.
