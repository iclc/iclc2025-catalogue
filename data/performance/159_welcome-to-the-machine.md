# $PROGRAM_NOTE

In 1975, Pink Floyd released Wish You Were Here, featuring Welcome to the
Machine, a critique of the dehumanizing effects of the music industry and
modern society. Fifty years later, as artificial intelligence reshapes industries
and creativity, we pay tribute to this classic by exploring large language models
(LLMs) in live coding.

Proposal for Live Performances 3
This reinterpretation involves a live-coded music and visuals performance
using SuperCollider, where a human also interacts with an AI modelâ€”"The
Machine." Visuals generated with Animatron illustrate the feedback loop
between digital and material elements, enhancing the theme of hybridization.
This piece invites reflection on the real-time creation process, questioning the
nature of authorship and the role of AI as an active collaborator in
contemporary creativity.
