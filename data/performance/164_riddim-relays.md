# $PROGRAM_NOTE

Riddim Relays explores the dynamic interplay of rhythms and melodies across
genres, tracing the evolution of sound from Jamaican dancehall, dubstep, and
reggae to urban styles like UK jungle, footwork, techno, and juke. The
performance highlights how these musical traditions have interwoven over time,
revealing shared elements and influences.
Utilizing tools like Sonic Pi, SuperCollider, Ableton, and Max/MSP, I will employ live
coding techniques to create an evolving soundscape. Real-time visualizations will
illustrate the creative process, tracking audio output and user interactions,
fostering a transparent connection between artist and audience.
Riddim Relays invites listeners to experience the intricate relationships between
genres, celebrating the continuous dialogue of sound that shapes contemporary
music and exploring speculative futures through algorithmic creativity.

# $ABSTRACT

Riddim Relays explores the cross-pollination of rhythmic, melodic, and structural
elements across genres, tracing the evolution and migration of these musical
tendencies over time. The performance draws from my personal listening history,
connecting sound system culture—specifically Jamaican dancehall, dubstep, and
reggae—with urban dance cultures, including UK jungle, Chicago footwork,
Detroit techno, and Memphis juke. By examining the transformation of musical
ICLC 2025  Proposal for Live Performances2elements, Riddim Relays highlights the interlocking threads that define each
genre.

Jamaican music laid the groundwork for bass-heavy sound systems and toasting
in the 1960s and 1970s, with dancehall emerging as a platform for rhythmic
improvisation in the late 1970s. Pioneering producers like King Tubby significantly
influenced jungle and drum and bass through innovative studio work in dub. As
Jamaican immigrants brought sound system culture to the UK, it merged with rave
culture, leading to early jungle music that fused reggae basslines with fast
breakbeats, creating a defining sound that evolved into drum and bass.

Similarly, Chicago footwork evolved from house music, introducing syncopated
rhythms and rapid hi-hats, paralleling the rhythmic experimentation found in
jungle. Memphis juke, a regional offshoot, maintained fast tempos while adding a
gritty aesthetic. In Detroit, techno emerged from the cityʼs African-American
musical heritage, blending funk and electro to develop a melodic yet driving sound
that resonates with the complexities of footwork and jungle. Emerging in South
London, dubstep developed as a darker, bass-heavy genre, influenced by dub
reggae and connected to the faster tempos of jungle and footwork.

Across these genres, rhythmic structures serve as a driving force. Jungleʼs
syncopated breakbeats, technoʼs steady pulse, and footworkʼs intricate rhythms
highlight distinct approaches while remaining anchored in a bass-heavy
foundation. The vocal traditions evolving from Jamaican toasting to MCing in
jungle demonstrate an adaptation of delivery to varying tempos, preserving
rhythmic energy. Deep basslines from reggae have influenced genres like jungle,
dubstep, and footwork, establishing continuity across time and space. The
practice of reworking riddims in reggae mirrors the use of breakbeats and
samples in jungle and footwork, creating a dialogue between past and present
sounds.

For this performance, I will utilize Sonic Pi to generate and arrange events in real
time, alongside SuperCollider, Ableton, and Max/MSP to create sound. Techniques
such as pattern generation, live looping, conditional logic, event scheduling,
deterministic randomization, sequencing through data structures, and iterative
prototyping will guide the live coding process. A performance documentation tool
will create real-time visualizations tracking audio output, user interactions, and
power consumption, offering transparency into the creative process. This performance embraces programming as an artistic medium, where live coding
enables on-the-fly parameterization, pushing the boundaries of improvisational
dexterity within computational constraints. Audiences are invited to witness this
unfolding creative process, exploring speculative futures through algorithmic
transparency.
