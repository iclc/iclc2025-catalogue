# $PROGRAM_NOTE

Riddim Relays explores the dynamic interplay of rhythms and melodies across
genres, tracing the evolution of sound from Jamaican dancehall, dubstep, and
reggae to urban styles like UK jungle, footwork, techno, and juke. The
performance highlights how these musical traditions have interwoven over time,
revealing shared elements and influences.
Utilizing tools like Sonic Pi, SuperCollider, Ableton, and Max/MSP, I will employ live
coding techniques to create an evolving soundscape. Real-time visualizations will
illustrate the creative process, tracking audio output and user interactions,
fostering a transparent connection between artist and audience.
Riddim Relays invites listeners to experience the intricate relationships between
genres, celebrating the continuous dialogue of sound that shapes contemporary
music and exploring speculative futures through algorithmic creativity.
