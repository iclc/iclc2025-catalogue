# $PROGRAM_NOTE

“A Dialog Between Live Coded Sound And Visuals” explores the common live
code performance dynamic of live coded visuals and audio happening simultaneously 
to create a unified experience. 

As the performers experience each other’s outputs, this.xor.that’s perspective of live coding 
visuals will be shaped by Cougars Are Cats Too’s audio and vice versa. During this performance,
this.xor.that and Cougars Are Cats Too emphasize the exchange between audio and 
visuals by allowing the sound-producing code to have a measure of
program-facilitated control over the visuals created and vice versa. Each performer’s 
screen will programmatically depict the inputs into their respective systems 
and provide algorithmic insight into the exchange between the two sides.

Visuals will be coded in Murrelet, a custom Rust-based live coding framework
and sounds will be created using a custom Max patch taking in live input from
a flute.
