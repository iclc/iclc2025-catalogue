# $PROGRAM_NOTE

“A Dialog Between Live Coded Sound And Visuals” explores the common live

code performance dynamic of live coded visuals and audio happening simul-
taneously to create a unified experience. As the performers experience each

other’s outputs, this.xor.that’s perspective of live coding visuals will be shaped
by Cougars Are Cats Too’s audio and vice versa. During this performance,

1

this.xor.that and Cougars Are Cats Too emphasize the exchange between au-
dio and visuals by allowing the sound-producing code to have a measure of

program-facilitated control over the visuals created and vice versa. Each per-
former’s screen will programmatically depict the inputs into their respective sys-
tems and provide algorithmic insight into the exchange between the two sides.

Visuals will be coded in Murrelet, a custom Rust-based live coding framework
and sounds will be created using a custom Max patch taking in live input from
a flute.
