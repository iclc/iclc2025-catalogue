# $PROGRAM_NOTE

afrontaciones => (f.) copings is an auto-ethnographic and artistic project centred on the practice of creating
“testimonies” and collective story-sharing through the complex layers of inhabiting a city crossed by violence.

For the performance, I used TransMit, a programming language for visuals that allows me to blend the digital
and physical testimonial materials I created for this project. These materials include mixed-media collages, typed
testimonies, recorded videos from my hometown, and video testimonials, among other materials.
I manipulate these testimonies during the performance, shaping and reshaping the project’s materialities. In
this convergence of the tangible and the virtual, I invite viewers to explore the interplay of memory, technology,
and storytelling. The collision of physical and virtual realms within this setup creates a space where narratives
resonate.

Many thanks to Luis Navarro Del Angel for live translation during the performance.
