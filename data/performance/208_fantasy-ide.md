# $PROGRAM_NOTE

How can we build more intuitive, responsive and playful interfaces for performing realtime graphics? How
can we create live computational performances which make computational visible, or which educate as well
as delight the audience? Char Stiles made a series of Fantasy IDEs to perform writing live coded visuals to
grapple with these questions. Through IDEs laced with cheeky realtime explination, interactive chatbots to
assist with raving (delivered via QR code), bewilderlingly layered with GLSL shadercode, the medium is not
only the message but the medium is the mess.
