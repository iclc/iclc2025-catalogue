# $PROGRAM_NOTE

Codex_Saqqara is a duo formed in 2022 by Francesco Ardan Dal RÃ­ (live coding)
and Francesca Zanghellini (electric violin, effects). They aim at exploring
the possibilities of co-creations between different musical practices allowed by
interactive ecosystems. At the heart of the project, five recording slots that can
be filled by the violinist and recalled by the live coder, establishing a game of
mutual exchange of musical ideas, in which the live coder has no control over
the sound material, while the instrumentalist has no control over its structural
organization. The performance is improvised from scratch, always seeking new
musical solutions by exploiting the interaction and collaboration. As such,
rehearsals are carried out trough exercises designed to refine communication
mechanics. For this performance, only two constraints are predefined: 1) the
duration (10/15 minutes); and 2) the starting sound (a C3 pizzicato). From
there, anything can happen.
