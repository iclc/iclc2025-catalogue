# $PROGRAM_NOTE

In this performance I will live code audioreactive visuals using Screamer, a new
domain-specific language I created. The main inspiration for Screamer is a
rendering technique named ray marching, that enable strange geometric forms;
ray marching has been widely adopted by the demoscene digital art movement
over the last two decades.
