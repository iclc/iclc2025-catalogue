# $PROGRAM_NOTE

Godshatter is an expedition into the mind of a Mesoamerican god. The journey is propelled
by Alexandra's live-coded audio, an ambient composition where a foundation of drones
supports a superstructure of experimental beats. GÃ¡bor's visuals map out the deity's
supernatural mind through a particle system based on a 3D scan of the god's effigy.

Fragments of the music's source code are blended and projected in real time onto the god-
mind's swirling spatial configuration.
