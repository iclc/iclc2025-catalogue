# $PROGRAM_NOTE

Godshatter is an expedition into the mind of a Mesoamerican god. The journey is propelled
by Alexandra's live-coded audio, an ambient composition where a foundation of drones
supports a superstructure of experimental beats. Gábor's visuals map out the deity's
supernatural mind through a particle system based on a 3D scan of the god's effigy.

Fragments of the music's source code are blended and projected in real time onto the god-
mind's swirling spatial configuration.

# $ABSTRACT

The phenomenon of Godshatter originates in Vernor Vinge's 1992 novel A Fire Upon the
Deep, where it is described as the fragments of a superintelligence melded with a human-
level intellect. In this performance the authors share, for the first time, moments from their
journey into a landscape reconstructed from the mind fragments of a Mesoamerican god.
To our best knowledge, no digital performers have previously attempted a similar journey
and returned to share their discoveries. The expedition is propelled by Alexandra's live-
coded audio, an ambient composition where a foundation of drones supports a
superstructure of experimental beats. Gábor's visuals map out the deity's supernatural
mind through a particle system, which itself is derived from a 3D scan of the god's effigy.
Just as a human mind can only ever access fragments of the transcendental, fragments of
the music's source code are blended and projected in real time onto the god-mind's spatial
configuration. Historically, journeys into realms inhabited by metaphyscial creatures have
been known to be detrimental to the sanity of fragile human minds (cf. Ulysses and the
Sirens). The authors' original contribution lies in their choice to journey in digital space.
This introduces a generative remove that shields the integrity of their minds (and that of
the audience), enabling an unprecedented expedition into a realm of Godshatter.
