# $PROGRAM_NOTE

Jitr จตร: extended gong ensemble is audio/visual networked live coding,
collaborative sound making, and an extended body of work from an ever-evolving
project, Jitr จตร. With two core distinctions: the MIDI network of imaginary
gongs connecting elekhlekha members and a communal music-making gathering
rooted in Southeast Asian indigenous practices.

Visual is a live-coding performative document assembling datasets from Jitr
Poumisak's writing juxtaposed with distorted propaganda footage, weaving in the
narrative of oppressed sounds, people's voices, and memories.
The gathering focuses on making sounds with found objects. The sentiment of
networked live coding is to democratize interaction with each performer. The
performance is created with specific frequencies tied to Southeast Asian sound
cultures. It uses these tunings as a constraint to create a ritual musical
performance, which is possible when everyone contributes with melodies and
rhythms spread out among live coders, eliminating the dominant force and
underlining each participant's agency.
