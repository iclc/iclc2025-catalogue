# $PROGRAM_NOTE

Give me a sign.¶

Grammarian is a message-based live coding performance for two human
coders/writers. Through correspondence with each other, their computers and themselves, 
texts, sounds, codes and notifications become messages that send a message. These messages change the rules
of expression, tamper with the dictionaries and histories, and the ways of agreeing with one another.

Will the audience find itself in a correspondance, or endlessly
“waiting for the host”?
