# $PROGRAM_NOTE

Give me a sign.¶

Grammarian is a message-based live coding performance for two human
coders/writers. Through correspondence with each other, their computers and themselves, 
texts, sounds, codes and notifications become messages that send a message. These messages change the rules
of expression, tamper with the dictionaries and histories, and the ways of agreeing with one another.

Will the audience find itself in a correspondance, or endlessly
“waiting for the host”?

# $ABSTRACT


J: Last night, just before bed time, I was thinking that mapping is
also a form of creating corresponding entities. ( )
So I think mapping could play a crucial part.

  J: yes corresponding in this sense is quite paradoxical
  mapping and remapping could be interesting
  this corresponding to that (mapping) is also like a dictionary
  but a 1 to 1 dictionary (one word only has one meaning)
  is corresponding "two parties exchange known & unknown in
  turn-taking" ?

J: do you mean the known and the unknown are corresponding through
turn-taking?
  
  J: no, but I think you just made it better :D


I really think this is genius generate meanings through misunderstanding
Grammarian is a message-based live coding performance for two human
coders/writers. It is message-based in multiple ways: While we, Jasmin
and Jia, are messaging each other, our computers are communicating
through messages via the Open Sound Control protocol (OSC). And—
following the concept of Correspondence and Mail Art—the “postal
service“ that makes the messaging possible is part of the artwork.
The title “Grammarian” is borrowed from Gertrude Stein, whose ways of
parsing sentences and reconfiguring the rules of writing is
influential to our way of writing code and words. We start a
correspondence; with each other, with our computers, with ourselves.
We reply with text and sound, with words, code and notifications. With
rules of mapping values and characters, we create and re-create our
own dictionaries for words, sounds, visuals and meanings. And we will
learn about our correspondence by the amount of data in the archive.
If we consider writing as a medium that is, following Jacques Derrida,
through and through historical, how can we explore its liveness?
Through reading, re-writing and (mis)interpretation we challenge the
seemingly directness of today’s digital communication. We trace the
rhythms of writing words and computer code alike.
Will the audience find itself in a correspon
dance, or endlessly “waiting for the host”?

Grammarian is coded/written in SuperCollider and P5LIVE. The latter is
mainly for displaying, processing and manipulating the textual
information, whereas SuperCollider is mainly for generating and
composing sound. Both serve as a communication interface.
