# $PROGRAM_NOTE

This performance by TOPLAP Athens is a network live coding performance that explores the
intersection of 16th-century metaphysical poetry and artificial intelligence. Centered on John
Donne's poem "The Sun Rising," this piece creates a narrative environment that blends human
creativity with machine-generated content. Five performers, each with a distinct role,
collaborate by combining tools spanning multiple modalities. The performance integrates live
writing, synthetic narration using voice cloning, algorithmic sound design, real-time text
sonification, text-to-video generation, and large language model interactions. The performance
structure follows the three stanzas of Donne's poem, each section exploring different emotional
and thematic elements. Interludes between stanzas allow for experimental coding interventions
and a sonic commentating of the poemâ€™s context. By merging centuries-old poetic forms with
available AI technologies, we aim to create a reevaluation of the 16th-century sensibilities and
affectivities through the lens of computational media. In this process, we draw a parallel
between Donne's chiding of the sun's presumptuous intrusion and our critical examination of
AI's pervasive influence on modern lives and creative processes.
