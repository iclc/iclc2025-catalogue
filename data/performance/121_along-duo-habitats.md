# $PROGRAM_NOTE

Along Duo Habitats is a hybrid instrumental and coding collaboration between Lina Bautista (ES)
and Timo Hoogland (NL). In the performance they combine drums, electric guitar and live coding.

They use the programming language Mercury to create electronic music with the collaborative code-
editor Flok. During the performance the computer acts as a co-performer making suggestions in

the code while listening and reacting to patterns played on the drums and guitar. Parts of the
code are pre-coded snippets while other parts are generated in real-time. By giving the computer
some agency in the performance they will have to react and improvise to the sound, resulting in
a dialogue between the analog and digital worlds of all performers. All this in an attempt to find a
balance between playing live instruments, coding live at a high level of abstraction, preparing code
in advance, and giving the computer agency in parts of the performance. This project has been
granted funding by the Creative Industries Fund NL.
