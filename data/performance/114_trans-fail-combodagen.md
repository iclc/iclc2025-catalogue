# $PROGRAM_NOTE

trans.fail is an audio-visual conceptual and artistic framework: a glitchy
hybrid performance sourcing data and transfiguration from number of
channels: media-oversaturation, home-made software, sonic explorations
and visual algorithms, hacks, glitchings, and number of thematic interests
in the background: slavic-romani myth-futurisms, gender fluidity,
imperialism, media theories, praxis and artistic critique of digital
capitalism. /combodagen is a further complication of the existing
conceptual framework with questions of community, body, and agency in a
livecoding a/v performance. The role of self-organized community of
autonomous agents in a decentralized and federated network is crucial and
vital to »liveness« of livecoding as an art form.
