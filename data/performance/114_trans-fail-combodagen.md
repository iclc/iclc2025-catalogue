# $PROGRAM_NOTE

trans.fail is an audio-visual conceptual and artistic framework: a glitchy
hybrid performance sourcing data and transfiguration from number of
channels: media-oversaturation, home-made software, sonic explorations
and visual algorithms, hacks, glitchings, and number of thematic interests
in the background: slavic-romani myth-futurisms, gender fluidity,
imperialism, media theories, praxis and artistic critique of digital
capitalism. /combodagen is a further complication of the existing
conceptual framework with questions of community, body, and agency in a
livecoding a/v performance. The role of self-organized community of
autonomous agents in a decentralized and federated network is crucial and
vital to »liveness« of livecoding as an art form.

# $ABSTRACT

**trans.fail** is an audio-visual conceptual and artistic framework: a glitchy
hybrid performance utilising prerecorded and real-time live audio-visual
elements and text, forming often frantic and chaotic mesh of data, images
and noise. It is sourcing data and transfiguration from number of channels:
media-oversaturation, home-made software, sonic explorations and visual
algorithms, hacks, glitchings, and number of thematic interests in the
background: slavic-romani myth-futurisms, gender fluidity, imperialism,
media theories, praxis and artistic critique of digital capitalism.

It’s a digital artistic research on successes and failures of media/gender.
How can a gender be seen, used, and/or realized as a medium for nomadic
thought, and how are contemporary digital media gendered in their
appearances and/or algorithmic backends? Historically gender has been
mostly an embodied experience usually coupled with a physical body. In this
framework digital media are used as a challenge to that asumption. Fluidity
of gender is perceived as a failure, a glitch in the system, while embodied
live expression through performance still invites new and undiscovered
perspectives.

**/combodagen** is a further complication of the existing conceptual
framework with questions of community, body, and agency in a livecoding
a/v performance. Perhaps a useful notion in this context is the activation of
»a feedback loop between the live performer and the machine, between live
and mediatized, establishing the parameters for live modification where
both human and computer edit the same script.« to quote from »Livecoding
– a user’s manual« where authors are reflecting on Fischer-Lichte’s
arguments on »invalidation of the feedback loop in a mediatized
performance«. Another influential theoretical inspiration is Donna J.
Haraway’s idea of sympoiesis, or »making with« as opposed to autopoiesis,
or self-making. In »/combodagen« the role of self-organized community of
autonomous agents in a decentralized and federated network is crucial and
vital to »liveness« of livecoding as an art form.

The performance employs SuperCollider and Processing as two main
programming languages. A video-rendering engine is written in Processing
that responds to OSC commands from SuperCollider in real-time. The
screen is showing live code from SuperCollider and visual material from
Processing in the background.

Both sonic and visual material come from various sources, including found
footage/recordings, synthesis and sound design, home-grown visual
algorithms and visualisations, and filmic quotes.
