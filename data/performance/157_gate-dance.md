# $PROGRAM_NOTE

In this performance, rhythmic patterns are produced by live coding binary sig-
nals using an embedded computer. The computer has a small screen and key-
board connection but very limited processing power. Sounds are improvised as

bit-wise operations between bit sequences. There is no difference between sound
or pattern. Life is reduced to an oscillation between two states.
