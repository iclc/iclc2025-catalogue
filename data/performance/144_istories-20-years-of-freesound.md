# $PROGRAM_NOTE

This live coding performance titled Ιstoríes celebrates Freesound’s 20th anniversary,
highlighting the platform’s impact on sound sharing and creativity. Using SuperCollider, we
retrieve and manipulate sounds from Freesound's heterogeneous collection of over 650,000
user-uploaded audio files in real time, creating an improvised composition that reflects the
diversity and unpredictability of the database. The performance navigates Freesound’s sonic
landscape through the Broad Sound Taxonomy, which categorizes sounds into semantic-based
classes. By embracing the dynamic nature of sound retrieval and remixing, this performance
transforms Freesound into a live instrument. It honors the platform’s collaborative spirit and
open-source ethos while demonstrating the platform’s role in fostering innovation within the
live coding and sound art communities.
