# $PROGRAM_NOTE

unsorted.loveâ€™s live coding performance centers on creating a dynamic feedback loop
between the audience, the code, and the music, transforming spectators into active
participants. Using a custom-built balloon equipped with movement and location sensors,
audience members generate real-time data that is streamed into both the visual and audio
live coding environments. This input influences visual elements in p5live and hydra, while
also shaping the music generated in SuperCollider, allowing the audience to directly affect
the sonic and visual aspects of the performance.
