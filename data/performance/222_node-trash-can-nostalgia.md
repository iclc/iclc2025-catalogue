# $PROGRAM_NOTE

Node Trash Can|{nostalgia} explores rhythm through subgenres like gabber, footwork,
latin club, noise, and deconstructed club via live audiovisual coding. The performance
combines DOM manipulation controlled by live coding with visuals implemented using
Node.js + Electron and various JS and CSS animation frameworks.
The narrative delves into 2000s nostalgia, focusing on mechatronic and cybernetic toys like
Furbys and Tamagotchis, often sold through the Fayuca (informal market) in Latin America.
Using AI-generated images of hacked, bootleg toys (Furbots), based on photos from Tijuana
and markets like “El Salado”.
