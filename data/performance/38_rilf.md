# $PROGRAM_NOTE

RILF (the ‘R’ stands for robot ...) explores resonances in the (uncanny) valley between feminized machines and machinized femmes. 
Resignified materials in the project include: Monica” (the Google AI assistant) answering psychologist Arthur Aron’s 
“36 questions to fall in love”; “Ann Steel” (composer Roberto Cacciapaglia’s feminized disco avatar); Donna Summer with an early drum machine; 
“Samantha” (the Apple text-to-speech voice) iterating on linguistics work by Natural Language Processing (NLP) researcher Bill MacCartney; 
TikTok streamer “Pinky” (Fedha Sinon) performing as a Non-Playable (videogame) Character (NPC) for the music producer Timbaland; 
the actor Scarlett Johansson singing as the character “Samantha” in the 2013 film “her” through Holly Herndon’s “Holly+” AI vocal clone; 
and the musician “Grimes” (Claire Boucher) pleading on “X” (Twitter) with the father of her children, Elon Musk, through her own vocal clone, “GrimesAI-1.”
