# $PROGRAM_NOTE

RILF (the ‘R’ stands for robot ...) explores resonances in the (uncanny) valley
between feminized machines and machinized femmes. Live coding in TidalCycles
with and alongside some bespoke SID chip electronics and SID chip emulations
made in SuperCollider, I resignify signal from “Monica” (the Google AI assistant)
answering psychologist Arthur Aron’s “36 questions to fall in love”; “Ann Steel”
(composer Roberto Cacciapaglia’s feminized disco avatar); auto-tuned Cher;
Donna Summer with an early drum machine; “Samantha” (the Apple text-
to-speech voice) iterating on linguistics work by Natural Language Processing
(NPL) researcher Bill MacCartney; TikTok streamer “Pinky” (Fedha Sinon)
performing as a Non-Playable (videogame) Character (NPC) for the music
producer Timbaland; the feminized techno avatar of Uwe Schmidt & Pete
Namlook; Zelda; and the actor Scarlett Johansson singing as the character
“Samantha” in the 2013 film “her” through Holly Herndon’s “Holly+” AI vocal
clone.
