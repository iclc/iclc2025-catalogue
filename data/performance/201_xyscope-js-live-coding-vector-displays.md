# $PROGRAM_NOTE

Live-coding goes beyond the laptop screen and onto that analog vector display of
the past. All media was one new, and the obsolete CRT screens of the past can
be reactivated through new + newer media. This performance uses XYscope.js,
a newly released p5.js port of XYscope for Processing, in order to convert vector
shapes to audio in real-time through live-coding, which is then sent to the vector
display (oscilloscope, laser). What you see is what you hear, as the visuals
transmit as audio to the display to become visuals once again. Through a
process of additive-synthesis, multiple signals are overlapped, producing audible
harmonies, rhythms, beats and visual surprises as forms react upon one another.
