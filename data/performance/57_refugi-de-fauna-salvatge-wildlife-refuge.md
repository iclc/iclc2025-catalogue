# $PROGRAM_NOTE

Refugi de Fauna Salvatge are an electronic music duo consisting of Ramon Casamajó and
Ivo Valdivielso, who joined forces in 2024 to investigate new possibilities in the sonic
territory. Their approach to music is heavily inspired by wildlife and patterns in nature.
Field recordings, analog pulses and digital rhythms are initially hunted in the jungle of
sound, then transformed into wild musical structures and finally tamed into crushed
whispers. Trumpet melodies and synthesizer phrases are captured and processed by
algorithms in infinite feedback loops. Julia Múgica, a biologist and computer scientist,
brings together the technical and animal elements of the project and creates live visuals
for the show.

The performance presents a balance between melodies and improvised rhythms and is
built on influences from both musicians: from contemporary electronic music to vintage
krautrock. The set incorporates live coded visuals and combines sounds from live
coding, field recordings, brass instruments and analog synths. Together, they create a
conceptual performance around wildlife, live improvisation and cooperative creativity.
