# $PROGRAM_NOTE

Since 2024, Ramon Casamajó, Julia Múgica, and Ivó Valdivielso have been working together to create music inspired by natural processes. Ramon and Ivó build sonic structures using code, processed trumpets, and analog synths. Julia, a biologist and computational scientist, programs visuals based on animal behavior patterns that respond to acoustic stimuli.

Each performance becomes a safari of minimalist melodies and rhythmic abstraction, in a proposal that draws from avant-garde electronics, fragments of folk songs, and electroacoustic experimentation. On stage, we find algorithmic composition and live coding, trumpet licks, modular synthesizers, and audio-reactive visuals. A three-way interpretation that evokes nature, improvisation, and collective creativity.
