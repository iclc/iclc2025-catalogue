# $PROGRAM_NOTE

A 30 minutes experimental audio-visual live coding performance with MOOFLOD
(Music on-the-fly with Levels of Detail), a Pharo tool born from a joint research
by the Evref group of INRIA and the MINT team of CRIStAL. MOOFLOD
employs the Coypu package for programming music on-the-fly pairing a Play-
ground with visualization widgets m and generating sounds and processing
audio combining Pharo and Faust into Phausto. Advancing MINT research on
Human-Computer Interaction and the perception of digital musical interactions,

MOOFLOD’s visualization framework, combining live tracing of the keyboard
input, the code itself, and an iconic visualization of the rhythmical patterns and
synthesis’ parameters is conceived to increase the audience’s awareness about
the musical performance. At the end of the performance, audience members
will be invited to answer an online questionnaire evaluating the efficacy of the
MOOFLOD visualization in enhancing their experience, in terms of emotional
engagement, appreciation, and understanding of the performance. appreciation,

tracing of the keyboard input, the code itself, and an iconic visualization of
the rhythmical patterns created and the manipulation of synthesis parameters.
At the end of the performance, audience members will be invited to answer an
online questionnaire evaluating the efficacy of the MOOFLOD visualization in
enhancing their experience, in terms of emotional engagement, appreciation, and
understanding of the performance.
