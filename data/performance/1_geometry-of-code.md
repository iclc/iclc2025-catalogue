# $PROGRAM_NOTE

A live coding performance inspired by the South Indian practice of Konnakol.
Konnakol artists perform vocal Carnatic rhythms by recitating solkattu, which
are non-lexical syllable groups related to the mridangam drum, while clapping the
tala. This is an ancient, algorithmic practice featuring algorithmic, geometrical
transformations of rhythm, which live coders have a great deal to learn from.

# $ABSTRACT

A live coding performance inspired by the South Indian practice of Konnakol.
Konnakol artists perform vocal Carnatic rhythms by recitating solkattu, which
are non-lexical syllable groups related to the mridangam drum, while clapping the
tala. This is an ancient, algorithmic practice featuring algorithmic, geometrical
transformations of rhythm, which live coders have a great deal to learn from.

While learning Konnakol rhythms since January 2022, I have been adding features
to the Strudel and TidalCycles live coding environments to better represent
them. The Tidal approach to rhythm focusses on fitting sequences to metric
cycles rather than adding beats together. Konnakol rhythms however focus both
on additive and subtractive beat-based transformations and fitting the results
to the cyclic tala. The result is the generation of complex syncopations and
long-form rhythms from simple ingredients.

As reported in a recent paper “From Konnakol to Live Coding” (McLean 2024),
I have been exploring working konnakol-inspired recitation into live coding
performances. This is work-in-progress, but seems to ground performances so
that audiences are more able to understand the role of algorithmic generation of
pattern in live performance. In this performance I’ll share my latest experimental
approach in this area.
