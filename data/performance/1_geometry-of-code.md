# $PROGRAM_NOTE

A live coding performance inspired by the South Indian practice of Konnakol.
Konnakol artists perform vocal Carnatic rhythms by recitating solkattu, which
are non-lexical syllable groups related to the mridangam drum, while clapping the
tala. This is an ancient, algorithmic practice featuring algorithmic, geometrical
transformations of rhythm, which live coders have a great deal to learn from.
