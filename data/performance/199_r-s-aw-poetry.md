# $PROGRAM_NOTE

(r,s)aw poetry is an audiovisual live coding concept where poetry is in the center of the
stage triggering sound, visual and imaginary correspondences. By following Felix Guattari's
concept of Caosmosis - "a generalized connectivity, an indifferent mutability, a systematic
disqualification (...) a nucleus of autopoiesis" as a path to reconcile "chaos and complexity"
that forms our ontology - the project explores cracks and limits of live coding languages to
discuss the impact of technology in our sensory biologic and humanistic systems - our
aesthetics.
In recent years, I have been particularly interested in the broad idea that language shapes
reality, by contrasting the thinking of Ludwig Wittgenstein and Vilém Flusser with
contemporary aesthetics, in search of a critical vision of the structure of our society, To the
Italian philosopher Franco Berardi the contamination of our semiotic process by
technology results to be an “act of reduction” of human knowledge as it becomes
constrained by the “syntactic logic” of the algorithm. I then focused my practice and
research on exploring concepts that address the relationship between language and
technology, that is, how we interact with technology and how technology interacts with us.
(r,s)aw is one of them. Enjoy!
