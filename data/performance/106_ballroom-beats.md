# $PROGRAM_NOTE

This performance will be a recontextualization of the beautiful ballroom scene and an ode
to queer expression. It's a live coded interpretation of the musical foundation used within
the Ballroom scene mixed with stunning visuals, live dancers and accompanying music. A
feast of improvisation and joy, where everyone is invited to move, dance and express to
these algorithmic beats.
