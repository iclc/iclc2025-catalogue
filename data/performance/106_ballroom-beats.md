# $PROGRAM_NOTE

This performance will be a recontextualization of the beautiful ballroom scene and an ode 
to queer expression. It's a live coded interpretation of the musical foundation used within
the Ballroom scene mixed with stunning visuals, live dancers and accompanying music. A feast of improvisation 
and joy, where everyone is invited to move, dance and express to these algorithmic beats.

# $ABSTRACT

This performance is a reinterpretation on beats used within the Ballroom scene. 
Ballroom is culture for Queer people, mostly existing of black, Latino and trans 
people. Within ballroom there are different categories, some of them consisting 
of improvisational dance, others of walking a catwalk in a certain style and showing of clothing and confidence. It's also about breaking gender norms and exploring your own expression.

This live-coding performance strives to give a representation of the Ballroom 
scene as it is around the city where Wilbert Vogel is from, Eindhoven, The Netherlands. 
It wants to create a musical and visual experience of Ballroom but in the expressive context of live coding. 

We draw parallels between Ballroom and live coding, acknowledging the liveness in both. 
Both artforms incorporate creativity, adapting and real-time expressions and
improvisation. All which come together in the heat of the moment. Another comparison I
see is the strife for inclusivity and participation. Where everybody is encouraged to
participate, learn and grow.

The music will be an interpretation of the musical elements used in ballroom culture, with
the core elements of what ballroom is being translated to the context of live coding.

We would also love to connect with ballroom performers in Barcelona. Who would perform
to the live-coded ballroom beats. Showcasing the categories that belong with the type of
music being coded. We would connect with the Barcelona trough locals of the Eindhoven
scene, whom have performed international alongside some active members of the scene
in Barcelona. We would combine the clips of Eindhoven with live manipulation of the
performance via a direct stream to the laptop of Niki. The stream and videos of the locals in
Eindhoven would give the feeling that they are dancing together. Crossing the bridge
between the 2 ballroom scenes. But also crossing the bridge to the live coding world.

The tool that will be using for music is Orca. Since the creators are also non-binary this will
fit in the narrative of queerness. It's also an esoteric coding language, the language does
not apply the normal rules of coding, but has created a new set of rules. The code breaks
the standard for what coding is. I see this as act of resistance, which is also queer.

For the visuals we will use Hydra. It's what we have learned to create visuals in. But
program in its self is extremely versatile. Also, the core founder Olivia Jack is a woman. We
find this aspect important, breaking the stereotype that all tech is created by woman.
