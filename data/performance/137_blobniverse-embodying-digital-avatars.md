# $PROGRAM_NOTE

Blobniverse invites the audience into a digital world where self-morphing, fluid avatars
take shape through the use of raymarching and signed distance fields (SDFs) as a
reflection of my digital identity—interacting with it in real-time through code.
As the avatar evolves on screen, its abstract, organic form becomes an exploration of
self-expression in virtual environments, where identity is fluid, shifting, and constantly
transforming. The audience will witness the interplay between human creativity and the
mathematical precision of computer-generated visuals, as code becomes the bridge
between the physical and digital realms.
Blobniverse is a reflection on how we construct and project identity in both real and
virtual spaces, pushing the boundaries of selfhood through the ever-expanding
possibilities of digital art making a special note on the history of procedural generation.
