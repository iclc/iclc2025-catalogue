# $PROGRAM_NOTE

Blobniverse invites the audience into a digital world where self-morphing, fluid avatars
take shape through the use of raymarching and signed distance fields (SDFs) as a
reflection of my digital identity—interacting with it in real-time through code.
As the avatar evolves on screen, its abstract, organic form becomes an exploration of
self-expression in virtual environments, where identity is fluid, shifting, and constantly
transforming. The audience will witness the interplay between human creativity and the
mathematical precision of computer-generated visuals, as code becomes the bridge
between the physical and digital realms.
Blobniverse is a reflection on how we construct and project identity in both real and
virtual spaces, pushing the boundaries of selfhood through the ever-expanding
possibilities of digital art making a special note on the history of procedural generation.

# $ABSTRACT


Blobinverse is a digital realm where fluid, self-morphing avatar come to life through
raymarching and signed distance fields (SDFs). The performance explores the
intersection of identity and technology evolving in space.

Through live coding, I will interact with my avatar, manipulating its form and movements
in real-time. This dynamic exchange between human intention and digital fluidity will
highlight transformation and self-expression in virtual environments. The visuals will
respond to code-based commands, inviting the audience into the process of inhabiting
Blobinverse.

Blending technical artistry with personal storytelling, this performance aims to challenge
perceptions of identity, blurring the lines between the physical self and its digital
counterpart in a constantly shifting, virtual world.
