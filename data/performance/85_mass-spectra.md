# $PROGRAM_NOTE

MASS SPECTRA is a collaboration between Maia Francisco and Tim Cowlishaw,
exploring the use of live-code as a tool for manipulation of acoustic sound and
resonance.
Stemming from Maia’s interest in pure sound, sine waves, the use of harmonic

relationships and enharmonic beating as compositional material, and Tim’s inter-
est in the use of livecode as a means of augmenting acoustic and electroacoustic

instruments, we have developed a supercollider instrument which isolates and
sustains individual resonances of an acoustic signal, making them available for
manipulation in software in real time.
We will present two works for this instrument: one for piano and livecode, and
another for electric guitar and livecode, that show contrasting ways in which
these resonances can be combined and manipulated in code to musical effect, and
demonstrate how the different affordances of the (electro/acoustic) instruments
we’re working with engender different ways of working with them in code.
