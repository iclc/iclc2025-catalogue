# $PROGRAM_NOTE

The performance, titled Synthrospection: Exploring Audio Feedback in Live Coding, delves into the creative
use of audio feedback in live coding. Live coding is an improvisational technique where sound is generated
by writing and modifying code in real-time. This performance highlights the potential of audio feedback, a
process where an output signal is reintroduced into the system, resulting in evolving, unpredictable
soundscapes. By incorporating feedback directly into the synthesis definitions controlled through
TidalCycles, this performance creates a recursive dialogue between the performer, code, and sound. The
performer constantly interacts with these loops, shaping the sonic environment as it unfolds. This
improvisational approach reveals the artistic potential of feedback, transforming it into a dynamic tool for
live sound creation and exploration.
