# $PROGRAM_NOTE

The Printer Jam (Project Cassiel X BITPRINT) is a performance duo using
livecoding to take advantage of the intrinsic musicality of 3D printing. The
performers create 3D printed objects that, during fabrication, activate the printer
motors at certain musical pitches and rhythms which are then recorded, processed
and looped, building up both physical objects and rhythmic soundscapes. Each
performance and its resulting artefacts are unique experiences. This work
“entangles the artist, machine, algorithms, and their potential audience in the
creation and re-creation of the work, questioning the finality and determinacy of
controlled fabrication processes” [Raskob, 178:2023]

# $ABSTRACT

The Printer Jam (Project Cassiel X BITPRINT) is a performance duo using
livecoding to take advantage of the intrinsic musicality of 3D printing. The
performers create 3D printed objects that, during fabrication, activate the printer
motors at certain musical pitches and rhythms which are then recorded, processed
and looped, building up both physical objects and rhythmic soundscapes. Each
performance and its resulting artefacts are unique experiences. This work
“entangles the artist, machine, algorithms, and their potential audience in the
creation and re-creation of the work, questioning the finality and determinacy of
controlled fabrication processes” [Raskob, 178:2023]

This work challenges the idea of 3D printing as a process for creating finished
objects by turning the process of making into a musical performance. Rather
than thinking about the objects as having physical dimensions in space, they
are re-contextualised as a series of printing movements composed from livecoded
rhythmic instructions in metrical time and musical intervals. This follows on
from traditions of thinking about dimensionality in terms of visual rhythms, as
in Paul Klee’s insight that “space itself is a temporal concept” [Raskob 2020,
2023].

One performer (BITPRINT) takes on the role of both live composer of each
algo-mecha-musical piece and conductor of the different movements and actions
of the printer-as-instrument, such as heating, bed leveling, material handling,
waste removal. They use the livecoding system for 3D printers, LivePrinter
(https://github.con/pixelpusher/liveprinter), running on a laptop and commu-
nicating with a standard 3D printer using the open source operating system
Marlin. The audience experiences this performance via a live camera feed of the
printer cavity overlaid with the LivePrinter coding environment.

The other performer (Project Cassiel) uses the printer as a sole sound source,
recording, looping and layering the sounds of the printer. These echoes and loops
revisit key actions, layering and contrasting sounds of mechanical movements
at different speeds, smoothing out calibration sequences and other parts of the
performance that aren’t inherently musical but are essential to the integrity of
the 3D printing process. This smoothing out of irregularities through sequencing
and iteration, to paraphrase Alvin Lucier, gives us a better understanding of
underlying rhythmic qualities of the machine in the same way that the resonance
of a piano and the reverberant quality of its physical environment immerses us
in the vibration of its strings, the resonance of the frame.

Audio is processed using a bespoke virtual mixing matrix controlled by a live-
coded Lisp REPL, routing audio between virtual effects processors and looping
devices. The Lisp environment can be controlled directly in code or mediated
using physical control surfaces such as Monome Arc and Midi Fighter.

This performance builds on prior work with “3D printed techno” from Raskob,
2020, live-coded performance by Project Cassiel at ICLC 2017, and performances
with sitar player Shama Rahman in Berlin and Tübingen.
