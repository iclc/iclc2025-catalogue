# $PROGRAM_NOTE

The Printer Jam (Project Cassiel X BITPRINT) is a performance duo using
livecoding to take advantage of the intrinsic musicality of 3D printing. The
performers create 3D printed objects that, during fabrication, activate the printer
motors at certain musical pitches and rhythms which are then recorded, processed
and looped, building up both physical objects and rhythmic soundscapes. Each

performance and its resulting artefacts are unique experiences. This work
“entangles the artist, machine, algorithms, and their potential audience in the
creation and re-creation of the work, questioning the finality and determinacy of
controlled fabrication processes” [Raskob, 178:2023]
