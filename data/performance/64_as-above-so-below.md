# $PROGRAM_NOTE

In the performance “As Above So Below”, Reckoner will use TidalCycles, Supercollider and
analog synthesis and vocal live-looping to perform a combination of composed and
improvisational pieces that he’s been working on over the previous year. The music will
explore groovy rhythms juxtaposed with sonic degradation via striated samples, misused
reverb, saturated drums and a variety of other distortion techniques. Accompanying these
sounds, Kastakila’s visuals evoke a liminal sense of nowhere-ness, reflecting themes of
decay and anachronism using TouchDesigner, Unreal Engine, and Stable Diffusion.
“As Above So Below” seeks to explore the inherent conflict between computers’ capabilities
as impeccable time-keepers and decision engines with their role in our lives as an
ever-increasing source of spiritual and temporal distortion.
