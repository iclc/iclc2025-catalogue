# $PROGRAM_NOTE

If Plato refers to craftsmen of every art as poets – it includes live coders as well.
But what if live coders actually used poetic forms in their code? In the piece
“Platos Poesiealbum” performed by the live coding duo hmhm (Holger Ballweg
& Matthias Schneiderbanger) this poetic approach marks the center of their
from-scratch SuperCollider performance: The versification of code. The number
of lines and the number or syllables within a line of code become a structural
part when presenting the code. For this piece the duo modified the live coding
framework flok to highlight different syllable counts with different colors, as well
as showing rhyming line endings and unit generators that recur in the code.
