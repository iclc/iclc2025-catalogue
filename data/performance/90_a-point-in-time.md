# $PROGRAM_NOTE

Ulysses uses nodysseus.io, a generic visual programming IDE for JavaScript, to
live code 3D geometry. Drawing inspiration from the industry standards of
Houdini, Unity's visual effect graph, and TouchDesigner, Ulysses creates 3D
scenes and modify their attributes on-the-fly. The live input of the audio is
one of a plethora of data inputs that make each performance unique.
