# $PROGRAM_NOTE

Ralt144MI creates hybrid audiovisual works by blending video memories with an
aquatic universe, inspired by revisiting a large collection of family scuba diving
tapes. The live-coded music serves as a backdrop for the playback of these tapes,
interacting with and evolving alongside them.
The project oscillates between techno music and electroacoustic compositions,
with a focus on technological archiving. Live-coding is used to control outdated
or obsolete equipment and technologies, bringing them back to life in a new
context.
