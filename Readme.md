In case you want to run process.py yourself use Python 3 - it should create .html files in the output folder.

You would need:
* PyYAML - https://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAMLDocumentation
* Python-Markdown - https://python-markdown.github.io/

If you want to also run the import.py script then you would also need:
* python-slugify - https://pypi.org/project/python-slugify/
